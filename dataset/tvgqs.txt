"You know the [ENEMY] pit we discovered the other day that everyone's been talking about? <SOA>Kill the beast with one of your fireballs from the top<EOA>, <SOA>climb down<EOA>, and <SOA>bring back his head<EOA>. That should prove once and for all that you deserve to be the number two man. Good luck and be careful, you know how slippery it is up there."
"Take this fork, and use it to <SOA>kill two special [ENEMY] in single combat<EOA>. Each will yield an artifact: The [ITEM] of [CHARACTER], and the [ITEM] of the [PLACE]. Warriors of another age might find these familiar. <SOA>Combine these together with some [ITEM]<EOA> at a [PLACE] for a special surprise! If you're successful, you'll be rewarded quite handsomely, with the [ITEM]. If not, well... I do love to watch a good fight!"
"I'm surrounded by cowards. We were robbed by a group of [ENEMY], they took all they could and killed most of those who tried to stop them. I did what I could, but if everybody helped we would've overpowered them easily. Hero, please <SOA>retrieve our [ITEM]<EOA> and <SOA>get rid of those vermin<EOA>. I'll be coming along with you, at least, as long as you don't mind."
"As you can see these lands have been corrupted. For the longest time we didn't know what caused it, but now we do. It's the vile magic used by those wicked beings at the foot of the mountains. [CHARACTER], please go there and <SOA>kill them before they taint everything<SOA>, <SOA>get rid of those hideous [ENEMY]<SOA>."
"My brother is such an idiot, he keeps pulling pranks on me and I'm sick and tired of it. It's time for payback and I know the perfect way to do it. My brother is scared of forest spirits, they're not real, but I'm going to make him believe they are. I've made this wooden mask, but I need some more items to make it really scary. <SOA>Would you mind bring some for me? I need [ITEM], some [ITEM] to make the eyes glow and a whole lot of [ITEM]<EOA>."
"I'm afraid my ship's crew is made up of a bunch of fools. They managed to drop a whole load of cannonballs into the waters below. I really need those balls back, <SOA>would you mind gathering them for me?<EOA> Don't worry, they're not that heavy, you won't drown. I think."
"I'm running out of [ITEM], but I won't be able to gather more. The thing is, I'm afraid of bugs and other creepy crawlies. Unfortunately, they create what I need. [ITEM] makes a great gauze and [ITEM] is a great disinfectant. What's even better is they're both natural and free! If only they weren't made by those creepy, tiny creatures. Please, <SOA>bring [ITEM] and [ITEM] for me<EOA> so I can continue my job."
"[CHARACTER] has fallen ill, he won't wake up no matter what I do. I believe we need to make him drink tea brewed from [ITEM], but they only grow higher up the mountain and I cannot leave [CHARACTER]'s side. Please, hero, <SOA>get a handful [ITEM] as quick as you can<EOA>."
"Ah, greetings, [CHARACTER]. I am in desperate need of your help. A precious [ITEM] of my family has been stolen. Rumor has it that the notorious [ENEMY] in the [PLACE] is behind this misfortune. Please, <SOA>get it<EOA> and <SOA>bring it back to me<EOA>."
"Young adventurer, I sense an eerie presence in the [PLACE] - the once serene forest now harbors a dark curse. <SOA>Go to the depths<EOA>, <SOA>defeat the cursed [ENEMY]<EOA>, and <SOA>extract the essence of [NUMBER] enchanted trees<EOA>. Only then can the curse be lifted."
"Oh, [CHARACTER], thank the stars you've come. Our esteemed scholar, [CHARACTER], has gone missing while travelling to the ancient ruins in the [PLACE]. <SOA>Find them<EOA> and <SOA>bring back them safely<EOA>. The fate of our knowledge rests in your hands."
"Hail, [CHARACTER]. A powerful relic, an enchanted amulet, has been stolen by a band of [NUMBER] mischievous imps. Get rid of them down in the [PLACE], <SOA>bring back the amulet<EOA>, and beware their tricks. The amulet holds a magic that can balance the light and darkness."
"Greetings, [CHARACTER]. The celestial observatory in the [PLACE] has been overrun by celestial creatures led by the fearsome [ENEMY]. <SOA>Go to the [PLACE]<EOA>, <SOA>defeat the [ENEMY]<EOA>, and <SOA>kill [ENEMY] to restore the [PLACE]'s function<EOA>. Our understanding of the stars is at stake."
"[CHARACTER], the elemental spirits are in disarray. In the [PLACE], you'll find portals to the elemental realms guarded by [NUMBER] elemental beings. <SOA>Defeat them<EOA> and <SOA>get the [ITEM]<EOA>. Only then can balance be restored."
"A mysterious artefact capable of time travel has surfaced in the [PLACE]. [CHARACTER], you must find and bring it to me before it falls into the wrong hands. <SOA>Go to the [PLACE]<EOA>, <SOA>defeat the [ENEMY]<EOA>, and <SOA>get back the [ITEM]<EOA>.

"As you can see, this country is corrupt. For a long time we didn't know why, but now we know. It's magic used by the evil creatures at the foot of the mountains. [CHARACTER], get out there and kill them - <SOA>get rid of these horrible [ENEMY] before they corrupt everything<EOA>."
"[CHARACTER], I need your help. My precious [ITEM] has been stolen. The cause of this misfortune is the famous [ENEMY] in [PLACE]. <SOA>Could you take it and give it back to me?<EOA>"
"<CHRACTER>, I feel mysterious being in [PLACE]. The once peaceful forest now has a dark curse. <SOA>Break the curse<EOA>."
"Imagine beautiful [ITEM], made from the [ITEM] of [ENEMY] and [ENEMY]. Never before have I forged such [ITEM], because nobody has been skilled enough to bring down the beasts. Could you be the first? Kill the beasts, <SOA>bring me their [ITEM] and [ITEM]<EOA>, and I'll craft the best [ITEM] found on [PLACE] or anywhere else."
"They're burning down everything! Everything.. everything is turning to ashes.. My family.. they even... [CHARACTER], I need you to avenge my family and get rid of those hideous [ENEMY]. It'll be dangerous, but I'm willing to come along if you need me to. Please, <SOA>take care of those [ENEMY]<EOA>. <SOA>Try to kill all those who stand in your way<EOA>, we don't need their filth in our lands."
"Excuse me, [CHARACTER]. Help out a person in need. I need more antlers, a whole lot more. You see, I use antlers in all of my decorating and I just build a new addition to my house, so I will have to do a whole lot of decorating. There are plenty of deer in the forests around us, please <SOA>gather their antlers for me<EOA>. The deer meat will fill up my stocks nicely as well, wouldn't want to waste anything now, would we. Fortunately I have enough left to reward you well if you decide to help me."
"Forgive me, [CHARACTER]. I'm in need of your assistance. Eye for an eye! Blood for blood! If they wish to play dirty, so will we. [CHARACTER], you've seen what they've done to our lands, it's time to unleash our vengeance upon those [ENEMY]. It'll be dangerous, but I'm willing to come along if you need me to. Be warry [CHARACTER], they're stronger than they look those [ENEMY]. You can kill as many of them as you wish, <SOA>destroy all of them if you want<EOA>, curse those lowlives. I had hoped I'd be able to reward you handsomely, but unfortunately I don't have a lot left. I know you'll succeed, but do be careful."
"Please, [CHARACTER]. I need a favor of you. Oh I'm such a fool! I decided to play hide and seek with the [CHARACTER], but my eyes aren't what they used to be and those kids are too good at hiding. I can't find them anywhere. Please, <SOA>help me find them<EOA>, I don't want anything bad to happen to them. Unfortunately there's not much I have to reward you with, but I think there's a few bits and pieces laying around."
Excuse me, [CHARACTER]. I need your help. Justice demands retribution! In this case it requires death! [CHARACTER], a group of [NUMBER] [ENEMY] killed some of our farmers without mercy. We will not let them go unpunished. [CHARACTER], be so kind and <SOA>deal with those beastly [ENEMY]<EOA>. It'll be dangerous, but I'm willing to come along if you need me to."
Tread carefully [CHARACTER], only a fool would underestimate the [ENEMY]. Killing them all won't be needed of course, I'm sure your skills will do enough damage to them. There's no big reward at the end of the line, but I think my reward will be more than fair. Now hurry, [CHARACTER], there's no time to waste."
Forgive me, [CHARACTER]. Hear me out for a minute. I love the feeling of moss beneath my feet, it's probably the greatest feeling ever. Now, I've come up with a plan which will cover the floors of my house in [PLACE], so I can always experience the greatest feeling ever. The best [ITEM] grows in [PLACE], but I'm too scared to go in there and get the [ITEM] myself. It's so dark and creepy in there. <SOA>Could you gather the [ITEM] for me?<EOA> I will do my best to give you a suitable reward, but I can't promise it will be amazing."
You there, [CHARACTER]. You've come at the right time. Things have been too quiet lately, far too quiet. Our scouts report many [ENEMY] have set up camp on the borders of our lands, war is surely upon us. We need you to disrupt their activities, slow them down while we gather more forces. <SOA>Do anything you can to halt those filthy [ENEMY]<EOA>. I won't be able to join you, but I have full confidence in you. I know you'll succeed."
Please excuse me, [CHARACTER]. I need a favor of you. We're completely overwhelmed. The war is at its peak and more and more injured come into our hospital in search of aid, but we're running low in supplies. None of us can afford to leave the injured to seek out more supplies, so we need you to do so. Please <SOA>gather [ITEM], [ITEM], [ITEM] and [ITEM]<EOA>. I wish I had something better to reward you with, but what I have ain't too bad either."
Pardon me, traveler. Please, lend me your hand. I don't think I can control my fury any longer, [CHARACTER]. My wife, they killed her, [CHARACTER]. Please, you've got to help me. Retribution and vengeance are necessary, please <SOA>unleash it upon those cruel [ENEMY]<EOA>. I cannot join you, for I have other tasks to attend to, but I know you don't need me anyway."
Tread carefully [CHARACTER], only a fool would underestimate the [ENEMY]. I'm not asking you to <SOA>kill all of them<EOA>, just make sure you do what I ask of you. I'm afraid there's not much left I can reward you with, but I think I can still make it worth your troubles. I hope you return swiftly hero, we believe in you."
"I don't know where else to turn. My little boy was playing in that abandoned [PLACE] to the northwest when a pack of [ENEMY]s surrounded it. Please just <SOA>turn them back<AOA>, and I can coax him down. There's not much time! I can pay you [NUMBER] coins: this money is all my husband brought back from market this past week. My son's life is worth this and so much more."
"Perhaps... perhaps you are the type of people who can help me. I am in need of someone to... perform a service for me. I need someone... removed. This scoundrel is no innocent! He threatens to ruin my life with... with the spreading of... accusations. He threatens to ruin my reputation and standing unless I pay him an exorbitant sum almost weekly! I beg of thee... you must help me. His name is [CHARACTER] and he frequents the [PLACE] Tavern. I have not been there myself, but I hear it is quite a rough place. You could do the deed in the main bar itself and likely none would call the guards. I know not if he will have friends with him though. Thank you for this. Upon your return I shall pay you [NUMBER] gold. A small price to have this embarrassment removed."
"Hi! I'm [CHARACTER]. 'Scuse me. I ever so sowwy to bother, but <SOA>could you help me?<EOA> I've lost my little dog Rufie and I can't find him. He's probably ever so scared wight now. Poor Rufie isn't used to strange places an' people. You're sure to know him when you see him, 'cuz he's just the cutest little thing. Here, take this as well. His favorite chew toy, it is. He'll know you're a friend if you have it in your hands. I have a small reward for you: it's another of his chew things, but we can get more where we're going."
"The name's [CHARACTER]. I've got a dirty deed fer ya. How 'bout you go down into the sewers and bring me up a body. Now, I don't ask questions 'bout how you come 'bout them and I don't want any questions 'bout what I use 'em fer. <SOA>Bring 'em to me when ya find 'em<EOA>. There'll be [NUMBER] gold pieces to relieve the stink of it all."
"I am [CHARACTER], though I thank you not to mention that too often. A local wizard by the name of [CHARACTER] makes his home in a moored Halruaan skyship. It would appear that he has the knowledge to reproduce these flying marvels and is currently organizing the sale of the recipe to Grand Duchess Liia Jannath. He has drawn up a set of rituals and has procured an [ITEM] fragment and an ancient statuette vital to the spell that keeps the ships aloft. These he has divided amongst his daughters until the deal is to proceed. I have been contacted by a representative of the Halruaans, and they have no wish to see scores of flying ships manufactured in every port. You are to infiltrate the [PLACE] of exchange that is known as Oberan's Estate, steal the ingredients, and return here with them. Simple enough. You would be well paid. Enough gold to give you a backache and, if I am well pleased, mayhaps a magical [ITEM] or two. Perhaps a little more, perhaps a little less. It entirely depends upon your performance."
"Mmm, be a sweet one. Could you do a favor for [CHARACTER]? An old lover of mine has followed me here to the [PLACE] and has been threatening me with some very dark magic. His name is [CHARACTER] and, <SOA>if you could just get a certain [ITEM] of his to me<EOA>, perhaps there are a few things I could do for you? Such as giving you a Scroll of Vampiric Touch, mmn?"
"Ah, fair adventurers, I'm [CHARACTER]. The roads of this fair [PLACE] are lined with fools, are they not? Two of the greatest are [CHARACTER] and [CHARACTER], necromancers grown bitter over lost love. Alas, but they use petty trinkets as their excuse for enmity. [CHARACTER] covets [CHARACTER]'s [ITEM] and [CHARACTER] dreams of her [ITEM]. <SOA>Steal those trinkets<EOA> and <SOA>bring them to me<AOA> and perhaps those two fools can at last find peace. For your troubles I will give you a Cloak of Non-Detection. It may be of some use to you in the future."
"I'm [CHARACTER], a very happy man. I've got to admit, I ain't never been happier. Got a letter from my lady and she's gonna be home reeeal soon... Just gotta find me a pretty little [ITEM] for her pretty little finger and all's gonna be just fine, just fine. But my lady, she transcends gold or silver or fancy stones. She'll have nothing less than an [ITEM] from me. For reward, if you're ever needin' a little work around here, check with Scar, second-in-command of the city guard. You can tell him I recommended you."
"Hey, I'm [CHARACTER], an aspiring writer. Have you heard? There's a rogue [ENEMY] with a belt fetish to the south of the Friendly Arm Inn. I had to bargain my new [ITEM] of piercing for my life out there. Wasn't even interested in an autographed copy of my book. Hey, <SOA>if you can get that [ITEM] back to me<EOA>, I'd be mighty grateful. You'll get [NUMBER] gold pieces for your trouble, and a new history book I've just completed."
"I'm [CHARACTER], a merchant by trade. I sell the small and shinies for the tourists in the [PLACE]'s Tower but there are none now there! Bandits on the roads keep the people off and away so I'm stuck with all this stock I am. Ward tokens I have of all shapes and size. Some I found by elven ruin and some I made myself I made. Maybe some good or maybe all bad but don't they all look pretty? I tell you what I will. I'll sell you everything I have you buy for low low price of [NUMBER] gold is all. Then I go home where they appreciate a bauble shine. Buy or no and walk the walk?"
"This whole thing is dirty to the core, that's what I know! These aren't your ordinary bandits here. [CHARACTER]'s been making regular visits to the [PLACE], so that's where I'd start if I were you. There are some documents in that [ITEM] that might be worth taking a look at, too. Now go step on some toes, all right? And you can tell them Ender Sai sent you."
"Hey kid, it's me, [CHARACTER]. I need a quarrel of crossbow bolts. If you could get some off Winthrop at the [PLACE], I'll reimburse you. there'll be a [ITEM] in it for you too. My father killed a [ENEMY] with it once, many years ago. Stabbed him right in the back, he did. It ain't no broadsword, but it'll do in a pinch."
"I'm [CHARACTER], a ranger. You've come here to fight [ENEMY]? Well, listen up: it's mating season, so it's primarily females coming up to the surface, looking to put on a little extra weight. They're hungry, they're aggressive, and there are a lot of them. Now, the point of this exercise is not to exterminate them, but to keep their population to a manageable level. Remember, they aerate the soil and thereby improve crop yields by as much as [NUMBER]%. Food is going to be scarce enough in the next few years, so keep that in mind when you're out there. No more than four ankhegs per party. After that it's catch and release, all right? Most of the activity starts about fifty yards to the east. Now move out, everyone. You'll get [NUMBER] gold pieces, if you stick to the quota."
"Hey, you! Are you either bored or foolish? Either way, I, [CHARACTER], could use your services. Some wiseacre tried to send a basilisk by freight and now it's broken free and is making a mess of one of the warehouses at the [PLACE]. There'll be [NUMBER] gold pieces for taking care of that on such short notice. Also, you might want these. They're an [ITEM] I obtained from a fence I know in a far-away [PLACE]. You never know, they might fit you."
"A warning from [CHARACTER]: know that there is a madman by the name of Bassilus who roams the wilderness killing any innocents that happen along his path. He's been last sighted in [PLACE]. If you were to dispose of him and <SOA>bring back his [ITEM]<EOA>, there is a large reward offered. It is a grisly task, but sometimes there is little choice."
"Come one, come all! [CHARACTER]'s got something to show you! Take a look at the stone warrior maiden. How long has she been trapped in this petrified form, no one knows! Be the first to learn, for the mere price of [NUMBER] gold. For that small amount of money, I shall give you a magic scroll, and with this scroll you can release the maiden from her stone prison. Think of the gratitude she would feel to her saviors. Perhaps she's a princess from some far-off [PLACE], or maybe a powerful sorceress in search of a concubine. You can't afford not to know! Buy the scroll!"
"Travelers! I am [CHARACTER], a mage of minor power. I'll pay you [NUMBER] gold, not much for heroic adventurers, but all that I have. An [ENEMY] has laid a curse upon my only child, [CHARACTER]. She is slowly wasting away and, without help, she'll die. The mage who did this is named Yago, and I'm sure that he possesses the remedy to the curse. <SOA>Would you track him down for me, please?<EOA> He's been staying at a [PLACE] called the Low Lantern. It's the playground for the wicked and depraved, a ship where prostitutes ply their trade. All I want you to do is find him and take his spellbook. I have enough magical skill to reverse the curse if I had the formula for his spell."
"What cruel whim of the fates controls this torment of me?! I, Mr. [CHARACTER], have heard nothing from my [CHARACTER] and his wife for nigh unto a week now, and all else pales in importance until I do. I should have known better than to allow his travel in these dangerous times."
"Pleasure to meet you. The name's [CHARACTER]. I'm from down south, where the Cloud Peaks tumble into the sea. A pair of [ENEMY] has been trying to move into the area. They sank my fishing boat and put me right out of work. sigh If they weren't so dang beautiful, it would be a lot easier to convince people of how much of a nuisance they can be. <SOA>Can you kill them for me?<EOA> It's a dirty deed but it's the cost of civilization, isn't it? You can have a [ITEM] as payment."
"Hi. I'm [CHARACTER]. Nice day, ain't it? Too bad [CHARACTER] here ain't enjoyin' it though, her bein' sick 'n all. I need to get her one of them [ITEM]. He stayed up drinkin' last night and got hauled outta bed to man the gates early this morning, so I bet he's got a few of them lyin' around somewheres."
"I'm just a little girl [CHARACTER]. Mommy says if you ever need to know something important, you should ask an adult. [CHARACTER], my cat, she was playing close to the [PLACE] and slipped... I hope she's all right. You can have this scroll Daddy gave me, if you find [CHARACTER]. I can't read the words yet anyways."
"Please, kind spirits, a wondrous ancient oak is in peril. It is the tree to which I am bonded! If it dies, I, [CHARACTER] of the [PLACE], die. It is about to be attacked by [NUMBER] who would defile the majesty of nature. They have avoided my charms and must be stopped before irreparable harm is done. <SOA>Would you heed my plea?<EOA> There is a [ITEM] that might help you on your journeys."
"Greetings, I'm [CHARACTER]. I hire mercenaries to escort caravans on route from [PLACE] to [PLACE]. Right now I'm lookin' for some strong sword arms, and I'm willing to pay high. It seems that one of the caravans under my protection never arrived at [PLACE], and I need to know what happened. I've been having a lot of problems with [ENEMY] activity lately, but they've always only taken the cargo and let the caravan go afterward. <SOA>I'll pay each of you [NUMBER] gold per dead [ENEMY]<EOA>, plus a share of any booty, if there's no one left alive to claim it."
"I am [CHARACTER]. A [ENEMY] has stolen my [ITEM], wanderer, and fled eastward towards the [ENEMY]'s lair. The poor [ENEMY] is probably quite dead by now but the [ENEMY]s, of course, will not recognize the [ITEM]'s value. <SOA>If you could retrieve it for me,<EOA> I promise to brighten your karma."
"I beseech thee, kind soul, please help. I'm farmer [CHARACTER]. It's strange happenings at my [PLACE], and I've not the strength I once had. I've nothing to offer, and even if I did I doubt such as you would have need of it. My son [CHARACTER] and his friends went looking for our missing cattle, then they just up and disappeared! Been gone for days now and, with all the bandits around, who knows what's happened. I don't know where they were heading, but I saw some sort o' tracks to the west. <SOA>Please find [CHARACTER]<EOA>. I can't afford to keep the [PLACE] without my son."
"I, [CHARACTER], have a small errand for you. I left an identify scroll with [CHARACTER], in the inner grounds. He should be done examining it by now, so <SOA>if you could fetch it for me,<EOA> I'd be grateful. I have a great use for those types of scrolls. Allow me to cast a little spell on you as a reward. It will protect you from any evil you might meet tonight."
"For your own health and that of your children, come no closer. I, [CHARACTER], was cursed with this fell disease as punishment for my wickedness... No, your [ITEM]s and magics are of little use. The only way to cure this sickness is to right the wrongs of the past. Behind a painting at the [PLACE], you will find the skull of my brother, [CHARACTER]. <SOA>Take it to [CHARACTER] in the [PLACE]<EOA>. She will know what to do with it."
"Old [CHARACTER] had his famous [ITEM] stolen right off his back by a batch of paltry [ENEMY]. Yeah, yeah, it's old news and if you make one crack about the [PLACE] being an appropriate place to lose it, at least, I'll put your liver on the menu. Now move on and let the next people in line have their laugh. However, <SOA>if you happen to find my [ITEM], I'll give you [NUMBER] gold pieces for returning it<EOA>."
"I'm still healing from my latest encounters. They did quite a number on me, those [ENEMY]. There's a band of them fortifying themselves in the mountains south-southwest of here... <SOA>If you could give them a taste of justice by testing your steel against them, that would do me, [CHARACTER], proud<EOA>. In an effort to encourage such deeds of righteousness, allow me to present to you this shield as a reward upon your return..."
"Hey, kid, it's me, [CHARACTER]. I woke late this morning and left my [ITEM] in the [PLACE] before going on duty. <SOA>If you want to get it for me,<EOA> it's in the chest at the foot of my bed on the right side of the [PLACE]. Quick now, before the Gatewarden catches me without it. You'll also find an [ITEM] there. I think Dreppin needs one for old Nessa. You'll get [NUMBER] gold pieces for saving my skin from the Chief."
"Oh, thank goodness someone came by. I'm [CHARACTER]. There's a [ENEMY] on the other side of that bridge, and it's coming this way! I can't run anymore! <SOA>Please hold it off<EOA> — I'll give you anything!"
"Hey there, you're new here, aren't you? Could I, [CHARACTER], trouble you a moment? I need someone to go club some heads for me. I was ambushed by a band o' [ENEMY]s within sight of this [PLACE]'s walls. Robbed me blind, they did, and I want to return the favor. I don't care about most of my things, but I want to get my ring back. My father gave it to me, you understand? The [ENEMY]s were just north of the [PLACE]. <SOA>Bring my ring back here when you get it<EOA>. You'll know it when you see it. It's a Flamedance Ring, and very striking."
"My husband is missing in the mines. All I know about the mines are that men keep on disappearing in their hellish depths. My husband is one of the miners, but he hasn't been home for weeks. His name is [CHARACTER], and he wears his wedding ring on his left hand. It's a [ITEM]. Please, <SOA>find him and tell me how he is doing!<EOA>"
"Are you going to be going down into the [PLACE]? If so, <SOA>could you return this [ITEM] to [CHARACTER]?<EOA> He dropped it when he went into the [PLACE] the other day and I haven't seen him since."
"Hi! I'm [CHARACTER]. That's my twin sister, [CHARACTER]. Mom and Dad don't believe us, but there's a [ENEMY] that comes and looks in our window every night. We're real glad we're twins because, if there were only one of us, then there'd be no one to hold on to when we get scared. <SOA>Scare away the [ENEMY], would you?<EOA> Mom says to give this [ITEM] as a reward."
"Hey, I'm [CHARACTER]. I've got an infestation of poisonous spiders in my cellar in [PLACE]. You'll know the house when you see it: just to the west of the [PLACE] Inn. Here, take these [ITEM]s with you. They're antidotes against the poison. Keep whatever you don't use and <SOA>I'll give you an extra [NUMBER] gold pieces if you bring back my husband's old boots that he keeps down there<EOA>. If you <SOA>bring back one of their bodies and my ol' bottle of wine as well<EOA>, I might toss in a little something extra too."
"I am [CHARACTER]. I do not wish you harm. My partner, [CHARACTER], has poisoned you. While you slept, he slipped a slow-acting magical poison into your food. You have about ten days to live. Common priest spells won't help you. Only one thing can, and that's the antidote. I can help you find it, if you help me first. My problem is this: I don't work for the Iron Throne because I wish to but rather because I have been forced. I have been enspelled with a geas. If I do not obey everything that [CHARACTER] orders of me the spell will take effect and I shall waste away. I need a way to rid myself of the spell. I know of a diviner at the market square who may have the answers I seek, but I don't have the money to pay him. <SOA>Will you help me?<EOA>"
"I'm [CHARACTER]. I just had some new [ITEM] shipped in from a far-away [PLACE] and I'm afraid I must have dropped the gauntlets into one of the shipping crates somewhere between here and the harbor. Please,<SOA> if you can find them before somebody else picks them up<EOA>, I would be most grateful."
"I, [CHARACTER], desperately need someone's help. [CHARACTER], my youngest [CHARACTER], has run away again... He's always had a touch of the wanderer in him and he knows how to take care of himself, but... Oh, I'm just worried sick. This [PLACE] gets more dangerous every day... If you find him, <SOA>could you give him this good luck talisman?<EOA> I'm sure we'd all sleep a little better. Let me give you this [ITEM] as a token of my thanks upon your return. I don't know if it's worth anything but it has been in the family for years."
"Hmph. I am [CHARACTER] and I don't like you. I bet you're another one of those adventurers wantin' to change the world or somethin'. Well, go pick on the [ENEMY]s to the south if it will make you feel better. <SOA>Go find someone else to talk to<EOA>, I'm no good at this quest stuff. I have... ummm... people to see and [PLACE]s to be."
"Hullo. The name's [CHARACTER]. There's a [ENEMY] 'oled up in the hills due west of 'ere, close to the High Hedge. Damn thievin' ball-o-fur stole my short sword two days back. The sword ain't worth the tin she's made from. <SOA>I'll give ya [NUMBER] gold pieces just to seal that<EOA> yappin' mouth of 'is for good."
"Hi, I'm [CHARACTER] and my folks aren't around no more and I ran away from my Uncle [CHARACTER] 'cause he's real mean. My cat's really an angel, though, and she protects me when bad things happen. Or at least she did. I can't find her now, though. I think she went back to my uncle's to get her [ITEM]. There's this [ITEM] that she loves to play with, but when I ran away I had to leave it at my nasty uncle's. If you could just get me the [ITEM], I'm sure Angel would come back. <SOA>Could you do it, oh please?<EOA>"
"It's me, [CHARACTER]. A bit of nonsense from a local artist named Prism. Made off with a couple of emeralds, he did. There is a reward for the return of the gems: a [NUMBER] gold bounty. Prism's fate is of less importance."
"I'm [CHARACTER]. There's some [ENEMY]s causin' chaos upriver, alon' the east bank, just north o' that bitch priestess. They took down my pal, [CHARACTER], and dang near hauled me under too. 'At's why I'm so glum now. [CHARACTER]'s mama's gonna want somepin' of 'is to bury, but I'm still gettin' too many nightmares and all to go back there."
"I thought I asked you to clean the rats out of this building yesterday, already. Hop to it! Get in there! Ah yes, <SOA>kill them like the rats that they are!<EOA> A glorious battle unlike any this world has ever seen... I'll give you [NUMBER] gp, don't spend it all in one place."
"Greetings, we are [CHARACTER] and Boo. Boo is my faithful hamster companion, and more than he seems. We have traveled far to explore this land, but now my charge Dynaheir has been taken from us. 'Twas [ENEMY]s, and once we have tracked them I will beat sense into their heads until they release her. Accompany us, and bards will sing the deeds of [CHARACTER] and Boo... and friends. Onward to the [ENEMY] stronghold in the west!"
"I am [CHARACTER], mage and recent convert to the Church of Selûne. I was the guide for Balduran's brave adventures to the ends of the world and beyond. The [ENEMY]-men are everywhere. The lycanthropes' lair is in Balduran's ship. My [ITEM] lies within. With it, I am a powerful mage. Without it, I am the pauper that stands before you. With my [ITEM] retrieved, I may be able to discover a way off of the island. If you go to destroy the lycanthropes' lair, <SOA>I would ask that you find my [ITEM]<EOA>."
"My name is [CHARACTER] and I can make you richer than you could imagine. I know where the [CHARACTER] dumped his greatest trove of treasure. Knowing that you are a dynamic and intelligent person, I know you'd want to join me in a venture to get this treasure. Well, we should be off then. From what my map showed, the pirate cove is located somewhere along the coast, just south of [PLACE]."
"Please wait a moment, kind traveler! You've got to help me! My name is [CHARACTER]. You must forgive me for my appearance, but I've been wandering the wilderness for more than a week now. My friend is badly hurt, and he might die if he doesn't get assistance soon. His name is [CHARACTER]. If you were to take him to [CHARACTER] at the [PLACE], she'd help him. <SOA>Please, can you do this?<EOA>"
"I am a proud member of the [PLACE]. I've been searching for a deserter. His name is [CHARACTER], and he should be traveling with a woman. <SOA>There is a bounty of [NUMBER] gold for his capture<EOA>."
"Hmm, I am [CHARACTER] and I prefer not to work with amateurs. There's a fat man by the name of [CHARACTER] staying at [PLACE]'s Inn in [PLACE]. He keeps a cloak with him in his room and I need you to get your larcenous hands on it and <SOA>bring it back to me<EOA>. I assure you that your reward will be handsome. <SOA>Try not to kill him<EOA>, just filch it off his person."
"You may call me [CHARACTER]. [ENEMY]! Oh, he makes me seethe! He's a mage on a power trip and what does he do? He acquires his own personal nymph and enslaves her in his quarters! <SOA>Seek him out and look into this matter immediately!<EOA> His house is in the northwest part of [PLACE]. I wish you luck and all the passion of my fury in your task."
"Greetings to you and yours, my friend. I'm [CHARACTER]. Might I have your ear a moment? My proposition is thus: <SOA>I would have you enter into the home of a colleague of mine and effect the release of a creature he has imprisoned there<EOA>. [ENEMY] be his name, and he has in his possession one of the most beautiful and useful creatures in all of Faerûn. It's a nymph he captured some time ago, and I know not what laughable plans he has for her, but I am sure she be more... productive in my care. I not so rich as to be able to offer huge gold, but as competent wizard I do have the odd magical [ITEM] of worth. Perhaps an enchanted [ITEM] will serve your needs, no?"
"Well met, traveler. [CHARACTER] Luckyfoot, at your disposal. If I might pull on your coattail a moment more, I have a proposition for you. It's usually nature-quiet by the Firewine ruins, even with its violent bygone. Those who died and did not sleep have mostly found their rest over time. It's a live threat that comes now, with a band of [ENEMY]s that moved in. Perhaps we could prevail upon you to rid us of this menace, and in return, a gift from us you shall receive. Keep whatever you find as well."
"We're being harassed by a Priestess of the Bitch Queen [ENEMY]. We don't even know why, but whenever we attempt to fish she turns the weather sour. Two of us were washed away just walking to the docks, but we cannot prove to the guard it was her. We be needin' someone to strong-arm her into leaving us alone. We've not much money, but I'll gladly give you a... magical [ITEM] from my grandfather's adventuring days. It's a meager amount for your trouble, but it would be a great service to us. Will you help a group of poor fishermen? She hides out near a small shack to the north. <SOA>Watch yer back and act quickly<EOA>; she's tricky."
"I am called [CHARACTER]. I am a traveling paladin. Ah, travelers, this wilderness is too expansive to keep clear of [ENEMY]s all on my own. Many gibberlings pass through this very spot day and night. <SOA>Will you stay here and help fend them off?<EOA> Fire magics work well against the gibberlings, so if you have such spells, use them."
"First off, let me introduce myself. I'm [CHARACTER], second-in-command of the [PLACE]. I need you to begin an investigation of the [PLACE] trading coster. The Seven Suns leadership has been acting strangely of late. They've been selling off valuable assets and neglecting many of their more profitable trading ventures. Considering the importance that the trading coster holds over the economy of the city, the Grand Dukes are noticeably upset. I've gone to talk to the coster's head, [CHARACTER]. He rudely rebuffed me, telling me to mind my own business. I've known [CHARACTER] for many years, and this isn't his usual behavior. I can't start up an official investigation, as there is no real reason for doing so. That's why I need you. I want you to break into the Seven Suns compound and find out what's wrong. <SOA>Use stealth in your investigations<EOA>; I don't want this operation to cause too much fuss. <SOA> most important person to watch for is [CHARACTER]<EOA>. Once you've found out as much as possible, <SOA>report back to me at the [PLACE]<EOA>. I'll pay you [NUMBER] gold for this favor."
"Hail, adventurers. I'm [CHARACTER], and I work for [CHARACTER] Rosena. She's the most skilled musician and actor along the Sword Coast. I have a proposal for you. How would you like a well-paying job as a bodyguard for my mistress? She's been having some problems of late. Some thugs have been hired by [CHARACTER] to hurt her bad because she didn't perform at his inn when she was supposed to. You can't blame her for not showing up, what with a villain like [CHARACTER] running the place. Just meet me outside of the Red Sheaf Inn, if you are interested in the job."
"I am [CHARACTER] Ghastkill, mayor of [PLACE]. I need someone to descend into the mines southeast of town and find what has caused our miners to go missing and our ore to become tainted. It won't solve everything, but it's the first step to easing the effects of the iron shortage. The town can give you a reward of [NUMBER] gold pieces. We are a small community and that is all we can afford. Please, go now and do what you can."
"Greetings to you. I am [CHARACTER], a humble servant of Our Smiling Lady [CHARACTER]. My request of you is an odd and very dangerous one. I will not hold you to it if you deem it too extreme. I would have you enter the [PLACE] and retrieve my son's, [CHARACTER]'s, body. [CHARACTER]sought to indulge his restless nature by sneaking about the [PLACE], and a high price was paid. <SOA>You must bring [CHARACTER]'s body to me<EOA>, that I may restore his life to him."
"I am [CHARACTER] and, to be honest, I could use your help. The [ENEMY] raids have been getting worse. I used to think that they were just your usual brigands out to make a quick buck in troubled times, but not anymore. They're working for someone... Damn it, this is a fine mess, isn't it? <SOA>I'll pay [NUMBER] gold pieces for every [ENEMY] [ITEM] you can bring me<EOA> — and spread the news. I want this whole region cleared, and I want to know what in the Nine Hells is going on here."
"I am but a humble merchant. Interested in a little business on the side, friend? I've a man who swears by his grandmother he glimpsed a white [ENEMY] up in the Cloudpeak ice fields. It was but a short ways south, and she be easy pickings for a smart sword. <SOA>I'd pay you good money for its [ITEM]<EOA>, so it's a guaranteed sale if you go. Keep it in mind on your travels."
"I'm Hulrik! You have to help me! The [ENEMY] are after my cows again! Ever since the [ENEMY] an' their [ENEMY] swarmed the mines at [PLACE], they've been makin' attacks like that more and more often."
"Hey, I'm [CHARACTER]! What is a thief to do, huh? You invest in some Boots of Stealth, you set up shop in the badlands to the south of Beregost and then, WHAM... Along comes a tribe of [ENEMY] and they tear the boots from right off your feet! Damn-blasted [ENEMY] bullies... I'll pay you [NUMBER] gold pieces to show them who's boss and get those boots back..."
"I be [CHARACTER], a farmer by profession. There's been something killing peoples in and 'round the farms here. [ENEMY] or something. I can understands if you can't stomach the task but, just between you an' me real personal-likes, I don't know who else is gonna do it... All of us haves been goin' for a week now without sleep. We've counted [NUMBER] [ENEMY] or so, so keep track as you <SOA>kill 'em<EOA>, if that's what you plans on doing. Once you got 'em all, come back here and I'll gives you the [NUMBER] gold pieces that some of us have pooled together."
"SEE the horror of the treacherous traps! FEEL the presence of the long languishing dead! MARVEL at the wondrous wealth buried below! NOT for the weak of spirit as I will NOT be held accountable for any heart failure during OR after our expedition! Step up, step up! One at a TIME! A special package deal of [NUMBER] gold for you, not that you would need a discount."
"In [PLACE], there is building in northeast section of city called [PLACE]. To find it, just go northeast from [PLACE]. The sea charts, they are in there. Most likely, captain of ship will have them. I don't know such things as chart retrieval, but you are hero, and it is no problem for heroes. There might be small danger, so I give you some gold for the charts."
"My name is [CHARACTER]and I am pleasured to meet ye. I seek the return of an [ITEM], more an icon. No doubt you felt the storm that passed just by and by? Village-home did as well, and the cloak that draped the village center was cast to the wind. I think it is beyond the wall, and will not risk the [ENEMY] to get it. Will you? I can offer little besides my gratitude. The cloak is a keepsake, a symbol of old times."
"I am [CHARACTER], and I am glad to be meeting. I have but a mundane task to ask of you, if you hear me out? The storm you felt that took your ship? It was fierce here too, and a cloak that draped the [PLACE] center was cast to the wind. I think it is beyond the wall, and will not risk the [ENEMY] to get it. Will you?"
"I am [CHARACTER], I fish for clan in these savage waters. Listen, outsider, may I ask you for help? There is a witch on this [PLACE]. My brother called her the Blue Lady and those of us who ply these waters have all heard her singing at one time or another. My brother, [CHARACTER], heard her more than most. I think that he went to find her. I think that he is under her spell. I must go and find him. This witch might kill him. He is strong but he is under her spell. I fear that she will kill him before he realizes what is happening. <SOA>Can you find my brother?<EOA> I don't know exactly where the Blue Lady is. I have the sense to avoid her, unlike [CHARACTER]. But I have only heard her singing along the west coast of the [PLACE]."
"My name's [CHARACTER]. I'm only [NUMBER]. In a few years my papa will let me hunt. Are you allowed to hunt? I've lost my dolly out in the woods. The gatekeeper won't let me go and get it. <SOA>Can you get it for me?<EOA>"
"I'm [CHARACTER]. Hey, how'd you like to be supping on fine venison and tippin' back the good stuff? I've the key to wealth legendary if you're up for it. No doubt you've heard of the labyrinth at [PLACE]'s Tower, eh? And how she's been pillaged so often that fat nobles go there for picnics? Well, the TOWER has, but BELOW are dungeons untouched! I've a token, a ward token to be sure, that gives entry to them. 'Tis yours if you'll but settle my tab so I can leave this fine [PLACE]... with all my limbs intact."
"Oh, please help me! I'm [CHARACTER]. They kill poor [CHARACTER]. The wolf-men. They attack us as we search for roots in the forest. Please avenge my [CHARACTER]. He was so young... They are this way. <SOA>Please kill them<EOA>, I am so frightened."
"Hello, good people. I am [CHARACTER]. Two moons ago my husband took my son out hunting with him. They were attacked by those horrible wolf-creatures. They... they killed my husband and took my baby. Others say that they took the baby away to eat him, but I know he's still alive. He's a beautiful little boy with dark hair like his father. He is [NUMBER] moons old and his name is [CHARACTER]. They took him from my husband northeast of the [PLACE], in the woods."
"Good day to you, stranger. I'm called [CHARACTER]. Excuse my, uhm, abruptness but I would ask your assistance. Just east of this [PLACE] there are [ENEMY]. They are attacking a small group of people. Please, <SOA>if you have hearts, come and help me fight<EOA>."
"Ohoy, I'm Captain [CHARACTER] Kieres. A jug o' this town's hardest liquor would make for a fine departure, if ye'd be so kind. Old De'Tranion brews a vile swill at'll do the trick. Ye can find the old coot at the [PLACE]."
"Greetings, adventurer. I have, or perhaps I should say had, a son named [CHARACTER]. He fell in with a crew of adventurers from [PLACE]. [CHARACTER] was always obsessed with the idea of being a hero. Alas, he has neither the brains nor the ability. Such is a mother's lot in life, however, to watch her children perform acts of idiocy despite her warnings or concerns. He and his thick-skulled cohorts took it upon themselves to plumb the depths of [PLACE]'s Tower. They bought a ward token from that shyster, [CHARACTER], and made ready to leave. Though I begged and cried, [CHARACTER] still insisted on going. The band never returned. I fear that they were destroyed by the mad dwarf's machinations. That is the tale, sad but true. Please <SOA>find my son<EOA> if he still lives."
"[ENEMY]! All I know is they killed [CHARACTER] when she tried to talk to them, and I can't face them by myself. At first they appeared around the house of an old mage, but soon they moved into a set of caves to the northeast, taking him with them. Forgive me. My name is [CHARACTER]. [CHARACTER] and I have watched over this area for years, and we never had any trouble with [ENEMY] before. Since they killed her, I've been half out of my mind with grief. Please <SOA>avenge my [CHARACTER]<EOA> and give her a proper burial!"
"Hold, traveler! I, [CHARACTER], <SOA>challenge your best warrior to a duel<EOA>. I don't fight women, so only men should step forward. I win, and you give me [NUMBER] gold."
"Hello there, I'm [CHARACTER], a blacksmith of some renown. An interesting piece o' material you got there. [ENEMY], if I'm not mistaken. Been a while since I seen the like, but if I remember correctly, it makes a fine set of [ITEM]. If properly treated it's comparable to full plate with half the weight! If you're willing to part with your shells I'll give you [NUMBER] gold for the lot of them. No more can I offer with business as slow as it is. Iron shortage hurting us all."
"Stop! You have trespassed on our territory. You shall not be allowed to leave until you have paid tribute. We demand [NUMBER] gold in tribute! No money? That is too bad for you. We let you go only if you win fight. Your best champion versus our best champion. Our best champion is [CHARACTER]. [CHARACTER] is me. Are you ready for fight? No matter, <SOA>we fight now!<EOA> If you lose, you must die! If you win, we must let you pass! Tread carefully, we will be watching you."
"It is so pleasant to see your face once again. Don't you recognize me? It is I, [CHARACTER] Sashenstar. I am so glad to have met you, especially at a time like this. I need to speak with you privately. I'm sorry for all of this hiding and skulking, but there are dire events afoot. You know that I am one of the principal shareholders of the [PLACE]. Well, I share ownership of the company with two others: [CHARACTER] and [CHARACTER]"
"I, Talon Yarryl, priest of [CHARACTER], have a mission for you! [CHARACTER] demands proper tribute, and that occasionally means artwork pleasing to the eye. If a piece of his fury can be represented, more might see and fear it. An artist visits [PLACE] now. The artist travels under the name Sir Sarles, though it is surely a fake. He is pretentious, demanding, and very good. We must command a commission from him. But he is not being cooperative. His commission is outlandish, and he demands illithium as his medium! He may as well have asked for dragon tears. <SOA>Convince him to work for [CHARACTER]<EOA>."
"I am [CHARACTER], a messenger sent by the [PLACE] to find someone to help our town. [PLACE] is under attack by [ENEMY]. The [PLACE] thinks [ENEMY] may be responsible, but we haven't the manpower to <SOA>find them and stop it<EOA>. The [PLACE] will have more information for you."
"I am [CHARACTER], a warrior priest. I must discover the truth about [CHARACTER]'s murder. <SOA>We must head for [CHARACTER]'s home in the [PLACE]!<EOA>"
"My friend [CHARACTER] has been taken captive by those [ENEMY]. I would have you enter their building and find [CHARACTER] for me. Short... halfling... thief... even one of your intellectual capacity can't miss him. <SOA>Go to their building<EOA> and <SOA>return once you have found him<EOA>."
"I am [CHARACTER] and I have been bound by [CHARACTER] to guard his [ITEM], and your [ITEM] it seems. I can sense your touch upon this [ITEM]. If you can secure the means of my release, I will give you your [ITEM]. I was captured in my home, on [PLACE], by [ENEMY]. He bound me to this flask that I might guard his things. <SOA>You must find my [ITEM]<EOA> and <SOA>bring it back to me<EOA>. Once it is within my grasp, I can break the enchantment and be freed."

"I am the spirit of the [PLACE], child. I am the water, the earth, the trees, and the sun. I am life and death: the eternal cycle. A druid who serves the cause of balance is needed. The [PLACE] requires leadership, a gentle hand. Will you serve the [PLACE] as such? There is much work to be done. Listen and learn the path of balance, the path of the Eternal Cycle. Long have the [ENEMY]s of the mound lived beneath the protection of the [PLACE]. But a new leader has arisen. [CHARACTER] the shamaness leads the [ENEMY]s to chaos. She urges them to expand their territory, and she brings more [ENEMY]s to the mound without thought to the consequences. If this continues, the [ENEMY]s will overrun the [PLACE], and nature will suffer. A servant of nature must bring the life cycle of [CHARACTER] to a close for the good of all. You will find [CHARACTER] along the path to the east of the [ENEMY] mound."
"It is I, the spirit of the [PLACE], child. Child of nature, you are again needed. Balance is threatened, and Chaos is at the periphery. Will you serve the [PLACE]? The [PLACE] is young in terms of nature and ancient in the years of man. Centuries ago, [CHARACTER] of [PLACE] established a protectorate of nature in these woods. Now, as [CHARACTER] knew would someday happen, his descendants have returned and old [ENEMY]s marshal their forces. A child called [CHARACTER] has recently arrived in [PLACE]. This child is the inheritor of [CHARACTER]'s spirit, but does not yet have the knowledge to use his power. Surely he shall be slain by the forces of chaos if you do not rescue him. Even now he is alone and in danger, his parents slain by an evil that haunts him. You must <SOA>find the child [CHARACTER] in [PLACE]<EOA> and <SOA>fight [CHARACTER]'s old [ENEMY]s to save the child's life<EOA>. The spirit that once was [CHARACTER] has gone forth to aid the child... but the spirit is not the power that the man once was and cannot hope to hold out for long. Aid him lest all be lost."
"We are the three [CHARACTER]. You must help us get free of this... creature [CHARACTER]! We are [CHARACTER]'s possessions, servants, and concubines. You must get our acorns back from [CHARACTER], the clan leader of [CHARACTER]'s [ENEMY] slaves. He is somewhere within this [PLACE]. Please <SOA>take the acorns to the [CHARACTER] Queen who lives in the south end of the Windspear Hills<EOA>."
"Greetings. I am [CHARACTER], cleric of [ITEM]. I would speak with you. I would hire you as a mercenary in the service of [ITEM]. I would prefer a person of faith, but you will be adequate. <SOA>Follow me to the temple of [ITEM]<EOA>."
"I am [CHARACTER], high priest of the One God. There is... something that you could do that the great one cannot, despite his vast power. The Unseeing Eye knows of a valuable [ITEM] in this area. The [ITEM] is a rod... or part of a rod, rather, that you will find atop a holy [PLACE]. I cannot tell you more than that. You must let your faith guide you. If you were to venture below, you could prove your worth by <SOA>retrieving this [ITEM] for him<EOA>. Do this, and I will allow you into our ranks and the One's divine presence. I have a key I can give you... This will allow you entrance to the inner chambers through a door a short distance back the way you came, at the sewer passages."
"Aha! I see a wayfarer has come to amuse [CHARACTER]! You must answer a riddle, naturally, ere I will allow you to pass this bridge. Here's the riddle, my friend: The poorest have it, the richest need it, but if either were to eat it, they would certainly perish. Tell me what it is!"
"M-my name is [CHARACTER]. I... work in the circus with my uncle, [CHARACTER]... I... I'm not a [ENEMY]! I'm an elf, a winged elf... or at least I was... This... this covering you see is some kind of illusion, but if you believe in it, then it becomes real! P-please believe me! Now go before something happens to you, I beg of you! If... if you're not going to flee, then maybe you can help free me from the chains that keep me bound in this form — and then maybe I can help you! You... you need the key to these chains. But... but it won't look like a key! There are a couple of... [CHARACTER]... in the north side of this chamber... Don't be fooled by the illusion, though... they are [ENEMY]! They have a sword which is actually my key... if you get it from them, I can remove the chain and regain my normal form! But please be careful! You... you can't trust anything you see here!"
"My name's [CHARACTER]. I was sent to f-find someone, but things have been gone all wrong! sniffle I've had all my money stolen, and I'm lost, and everyone's so mean. sniff I was sent to find someone who could h-help my village, [PLACE]. Terrible things are happening there, and nobody knows what to do! Everyone says they seen strange b-beasts out in the hills. Everyone's so frightened! There's even t-t-talk that Umar herself has returned! When you get to [PLACE], talk to Minister [CHARACTER]! He can tell you everything else!"
"My name is [CHARACTER]. Something's wrong with my daughter. Her name is [CHARACTER]. She's hurt, traveler. I don't know what's wrong with her. She just lies in bed staring at the wall. Won't even eat. Please heal her. She's just a little girl. Please, you must go and find out exactly what [CHARACTER] knows about [CHARACTER]'s condition. <SOA>You'll find him in the [PLACE]<EOA>."
"Hmmn. I don't remember seeing you down here before. Me name be [CHARACTER]. Oh, the sewers aren't so terrible. The guards don't be comin' down here, and my customers like to be somewhere... out of sight. 'Tis the beasties that are the biggest problem, especially of late. There's this sea troll. People have 'em as pets, and when they grow too large, they huck 'em down here to torment me. I suppose I could part with a few coins for the deed. I tell you what... <SOA>dispose of the [ENEMY] for me<EOA>, an' I'll be pleased to pay you [NUMBER] gold pieces, aye?"
"Come... follow me inside o' [PLACE]'s, and let's have a little talk wi' [CHARACTER], aye? I do believe he is on the second floor. I be a poor, poor man, me pal... I have almost nothing to offer ye. <SOA>I beg ye to help<EOA> a destitute teacher find some justice!"
"I am [CHARACTER] Arenthis of the church of Lathander... excuse my young charge. [CHARACTER] doesn't talk much since the recent death of her parents. There is very little that can be done for her as well... other than to put her into an orphanage, I suppose. She is so shy and sad, though, I am sure it will do her no good. If only there were someone who would care for her. <SOA>Might you know of someone who would make a suitable guardian?<EOA>"
"Me [ENEMY]... lead fellows from great army of [ENEMY] in the south. No want to kill races no more. Lead fellows in desertion. We just wants be left alone. Always [ENEMY] and fellows be chased and hated 'cause me an ogre! We just wants to be left alone. We come here one moon ago, tries to settle for a while, yes? We needs you bring word to human village... humans run when [ENEMY] goes, so me needs youse to do it for me. Youse bring word, yes? [ENEMY] no want death... [ENEMY] no want fight. Just want peace. <SOA>You tell villagers, maybe, that [ENEMY] and fellows will protect village<EOA>... protect from orcs in mountains, yes? We have shield to give you... is magic, from [ENEMY]'s army... we no use. Maybe you like."
"I am [CHARACTER], a Cowled Wizard, and I have been assigned to offer you... a special deal. You just recently took this sphere, and by all rights we should have it, but my superiors said to offer an alternative. It would seem we have need of you. That said, they would like to offer an exchange. You may operate in this awkwardly placed sphere if you agree to certain duties for the Cowled Wizards. It is simple: You may have this place and act freely as a wizard. In exchange,<SOA> you do the odd task for us, acting when we can't because of political or other reasons<EOA>."
"My daughter is gone! I left my home in your care! I... I... no, no, I know it was not you... I know who my [ENEMY] are. Damn that [CHARACTER]! What is his grief with me?! I don't know where you will find him. His hooligans prevent searching. I don't know... Perhaps the ruins in the northeast? I don't know... Please rescue my child, no matter the risk. You will travel unmolested, for my pleas of your virtue were heard at the Radiant Heart. They demand justice for the slain knights, so that is your task now. <SOA>Do this<EOA>, and your honor shall be restored."
"Greetings, Your Grace. I actually have a rather angry merchant by the name of [CHARACTER] Bendelia that has been demanding to see you. It might have something to do with his caravan being waylaid by [ENEMY] passing through the region, but he refuses to speak to anyone but Your Grace. He is an influential merchant in this area; I believe he owns the deed to more than one local farmhold. <SOA>Will you grant this man an audience, my liege?<EOA> I shall show him in."
"Greetings, my liege. It is I, [CHARACTER], your captain of the guard. I am not sure if you have been aware, but we have been experiencing a number of thefts in the keep over the past couple of weeks. A goblet, some silverware, a few coins from the servants' quarters. All of these things have value, although none of them were major thefts. Still... I investigated. [CHARACTER] here is one of the new guards. I caught him red-handed, attempting to take a necklace that belonged to the late Lady de'Arnise. [CHARACTER] has confessed his crime. I am unsure how to punish him, my liege, so I have brought this before you. He is your subject, my liege, so yours is the right to decide punishment, but you are also... being watched carefully by those who oppose your rule, however."
"My name be [CHARACTER], priest of [ITEM], the god of battles! Hahr... it has been some time since I have rested my feet in any place, to tell the truth. I've been wandering for many a year now. The traveling does wear on me, to tell the truth. I've come to ask if you've a chapel that a priest of [ITEM] might set himself up in... bring the good Word to the folk of the area. What do you say, eh? If my manner does not strike you as offensive, I would be glad to be chaplain of your wee keep here. I can help your people here much while I stay. But I do not promise to stay for long. Either you accept me or you don't, my liege... that is your choice, and I'll not begrudge it you."
"I am [CHARACTER], and I have been cursed. I am dead yet not dead. Cursed to eternal entrapment in this tomb by cruel [ENEMY]! Cursed to a fate worse than death! But the curse can be reversed! With your assistance, I may live again. I have suffered for so long... will you help me? The fiends that did this to me keep me from returning by tearing apart my mortal form and keeping the pieces separated. You must find my body that I might again take mortal form. The pieces are very close! I have no doubt that they lie within the [PLACE] in tombs such as this. My [ENEMY] are predictable if nothing else. Seek my arms, legs, and torso. I will give you anything you want. Power, riches beyond [NUMBER]! Anything!"
"We are two imps, little demonic people. We want to play a game. Okay, big peoples... this is how our game will go! There is [NUMBER] chests here with nothings in them! In front of each empty chest, a famous big people will appear! Famous big people! Oh, yes, powerful famous big people! Each famous big people will give you a gift that belongs to another famous big people... and they will hints to you what gifts belong to them! If you thinks you knows which famous big people a gift belongs to, you puts it in the empty chest behind them, yes? Very simple! Once you places all [NUMBER], you comes and asks us! If you wrong, we laugh at you! If you right, we open the [NUMBER] chest! The [NUMBER] chest has all of the drow's treasure! All of it!"
"Hey! It's me, [CHARACTER]. I... I've found you again, my noble ranger! It's... it's so hard to find you sometimes! The... the [PLACE] is in danger again! The Minister has asked for you! It's [ENEMY]! The witch! She's come back, and she's threatened to kill everyone if they don't go an' leave right now! The... the Minister says he will tell you everything!"
"[CHARACTER]! That... that fat excuse for a slaver, he's cursed me! Damn him! If the curse was tailored to me, it might resist removal by normal means. I doubt [CHARACTER] would have done this if the solution were simple. I have a few options. [CHARACTER] mentioned that [CHARACTER] lived in squalor, suggesting [CHARACTER] may be in the poor section of the [PLACE]. Not likely to find [CHARACTER] quick though. The mages with [CHARACTER] wore odd colors that might be traceable. Ask at the government building, as all magic is regulated in [PLACE]. If they will talk... [CHARACTER] also mentioned [ENEMY], a merchant that helped expose [CHARACTER]. [ENEMY] frequents the [PLACE], and the bartender Bernard might know [ENEMY]'s whereabouts. My very bones ache today. It is as though I age on the inside. Ohh, this cannot go on for long. <SOA>We must remove this curse!<EOA>"
"Greetings, traveler. I am Sir Ryan Trawl. I have heard of you. I would like to offer you the opportunity to help the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. The task of being a paladin is not easy. Many break under the demands of our path and leave to pursue avenues of life more appropriate to their talents. Sometimes they bend instead of break, twisting their paladinhood to serve their own purpose. These are hard to detect, but when found, they are quickly cast out. Recently, one of our highest-ranking officers was implicated in smuggling slaves. His name is [CHARACTER], and though [CHARACTER] was once a friend, [CHARACTER] was expelled from the Order. We thought that the end of it, but [CHARACTER] took others when [CHARACTER] left. [CHARACTER] is a charismatic [ENEMY], and some of the younger knights were swayed by [CHARACTER]'s words. We could tolerate their loss, but they masquerade as paladins, abusing our good name. They extort, smuggle slaves, and spit on all that we honor. The Fallen Paladins, as they're known, would recognize any of our Order, and some also fear conflict with former friends, so we need outside help in this matter. The Fallen Paladins always need warriors to aid their illegal activities. We want you to ally with them, especially [CHARACTER]. [CHARACTER]'s the key to them all. If you consider these men a threat, then do what you think is necessary. [ITEM]s of Healing would be a suitable reward for the task, I think. [CHARACTER] has kept their activities localized in the [PLACE] District. I suggest you search there. May [ENEMY] be with you."
"Oh, [CHARACTER]! Thank the gods that I've found you! I've hurt [CHARACTER]! You have to save [CHARACTER]! I didn't mean to do it. I bought a love potion from [CHARACTER] the peddler at the market square. I just wanted [CHARACTER] to love me. [CHARACTER] only had a sip of it, and [CHARACTER] collapsed. [CHARACTER] is with your mother, [CHARACTER]. How was I to know it was poison? Oh, please hurry! I will meet you in [PLACE]."
"I'm Lieutenant Aegisfield. I'm warning everyone so as to get the word out that there are guards on the streets. We've had a... a string of killings, and I don't want any more happening. [ENEMY] I can understand; they are easy enough to figure out. What's happening here is... it's murder, but not like I've ever seen. There's a disgustingly sick person out there, and I simply don't have the manpower to protect everyone. [CHARACTER]'s been killing paupers, sometimes in the alley where they sleep. They have nothing to take. [CHARACTER] kills them and that is all. Not only is it pointless, but [CHARACTER] does it in as painful a way as possible. It's... it's sick. [CHARACTER] flays them... alive. There has been blood all over the area. I must go about my rounds. If you find any information about the murders, be sure to let me know. Don't go looking for trouble though."
"Hail there! I said I would return, and I have. Sorry to have kept you waiting, but there were things I had to take care of. Now that we have met once again, there is something I must ask of you. We must go to the [ENEMY] Hold in [PLACE]. I have been asked to bring you, and we must go soon. They will allow us to pass the wards of the door, but I must be with you."
"I'm Therndle Daglefodd, a merchant. My child, [CHARACTER] Daglefodd, has been missing for a tunnel's worth of digging. I simply cannot work without knowing [CHARACTER]'s fate. <SOA>Could you have a look for [CHARACTER]?<EOA>"
"Ah! It is the hero of [PLACE], come to see me at last. I trust that all is well? That pig, [CHARACTER] [ENEMY], did not speak too harshly about me, I trust? No matter. He is a stubborn, deluded fool. Our families have been at odds for generations, you see. The [ENEMY] [CHARACTER]s refuse to acknowledge the fact that we are the only true noble family in [PLACE], having founded it. Why they would think themselves higher than they are is beyond my ken. What is unfortunate, however, is that my family has never had actual, physical proof of the truth of our claim. That has changed, however. A tome has recently been uncovered... an old tome belonging to my family... that states there is proof right here in [PLACE] under our noses. In the graveyard, here in town, lies the crypt of the founder... my ancestor. With him lies the [ITEM] of [ITEM]. A pretty name for an old gold circlet. That circlet, however, would prove my claim once and for all and shut those [ENEMY] [CHARACTER]s up. I would get it myself, but the tomb is haunted, you see. Here is the key to the tomb... the fact that we possess it is yet more proof of our legitimacy. Use it to enter and obtain the [ITEM], and then return to me when you are done. You are a hero <SOA>who might enter that tomb and retrieve the circlet for me<EOA>, if you are willing. In return, I will pay you [NUMBER] gold. What do you say, my hero?"
"I will give you your next assignment. The [ENEMY] [CHARACTER]s have other enemies besides me. Recently, they uncovered a traitor, and have been questioning him quite ruthlessly for some days now. You will rescue him. He will be killed once they are through, so go quickly. They have him at the [ENEMY] [CHARACTER] guild house on the second floor. You know the building, I think? The man's name is [CHARACTER] Flynn. Remember, if he dies, you fail. Good luck."
"Now I ask for a more specific task that will disrupt the [ENEMY] [CHARACTER]s further. The task is... unseemly. It calls for the murder of a man. Not a truly innocent man, but hardly a villain of epic scope. You must kill, blaming the murder on the [ENEMY] [CHARACTER]s. He is head of a merchant house, and his link to [ENEMY] [CHARACTER]s is blatant. If he were to die and certain gear were at the scene, it would implicate the guild we oppose. Take this [ITEM] and [ITEM], and go kill Senior [CHARACTER] [ENEMY]. When he is dead, put the [ITEM] and [ITEM] in the fountain in his house. He will die easily, though there may be guards. His small house is in the Government District, between the jail and the government building. <SOA>Go.<EOA>"
"Again, I require your talents. Now to the task at hand. It is time to take down the leadership of the [ENEMY] [CHARACTER]s and throw them into a more permanent disarray from which they may not recover. You must invade their lair one last time. You must kill [CHARACTER] Linvail, the [ENEMY]. Do this for me, and our arrangement will be fulfilled. [CHARACTER] is in the basement of the [ENEMY] [CHARACTER] guild house, so you need a key. The lock is likely unpickable. What good is a lock in a [ENEMY] [CHARACTER]s' guild if any [ENEMY] [CHARACTER] can pick it? One more thing: [CHARACTER], an employee of mine, is missing, and the [ENEMY] [CHARACTER]s may have him. <SOA>Find him, and he may tell you how to access [CHARACTER]'s sanctum<EOA>. <SOA>Go now!<EOA>"
"Greetings. I am [CHARACTER]. I represent one of the masters of the [PLACE] order of the Cowled Wizards. He seeks to employ you in a matter of some urgency. The matter is most sensitive... I have been given little knowledge of it. [CHARACTER], the one whom I speak for, is eager to meet with you and discuss these matters. Master [CHARACTER] can be found in the government building behind me... you may go within. Do not tarry overlong, my friend."
"I am [CHARACTER], a proud member of the [PLACE] Cowled Wizards. This matter must be handled with discretion and expediency. There is something that has been plaguing us for more than a week now and has become quite alarming. You know of the prevailing attitude against magic here in [PLACE], yes? Well, amongst some it is even worse than that... a burning, palpable hatred. One particular man here in [PLACE] has murdered two of our number in cold blood. He is currently in hiding, and we need you to track the fellow down. We have been unable to do so, much to our frustration. Cowled Wizards cannot be assaulted without repercussions or it will lead to... serious problems. He is [CHARACTER] Corthala, last son of a wealthy family and a true brute. Ask around and you may discover if he is hiding within the city or someplace else. He has a home here in the Docks District, or he may have fled to the Umar Hills. His friends and servants will not speak to us, but they may to you. We do not ask that you commit any murder. We wish [CHARACTER] be delivered to us, that is all. He will likely resist, so <SOA>if you must kill him, so be it<EOA>. But if you do kill him, I simply must have his body. [CHARACTER] must be delivered to us whether he is dead or alive. You understand, yes?"
"Welcome to my humble accommodations, adventurer. Will you hear out my tale? As I said before, my name is [CHARACTER]... I hail from [PLACE] to the south, where I was a merchant. A successful one. I... suppose that is where I first came into contact with [ENEMY]. [ENEMY] is a lich, adventurer. A powerful one. In [PLACE], there are many strange wonders of magic, and [ENEMY] is not out of place. It is [ENEMY] who has chased us here, hunting us mercilessly. [ENEMY] desired my poor [ITEM], my daughter. She is the young woman here on the bed. A... a good girl, a virgin and pure of heart. [ENEMY] desired her soul, [ENEMY] said, so I fled [PLACE] with her. But [ENEMY] caught up to us nevertheless. And somehow [ENEMY] has taken her soul despite my efforts! She... she lies near death, and there is nothing the local priestess can do to help her. I know [ENEMY] is in the cavern that serves as a graveyard in this [PLACE]. I told the monks about him... but they sealed off the cavern rather than somehow getting my daughter's soul back as I had hoped. [ITEM] is the world to me! And I do not know how much longer [ENEMY] will remain trapped in that cavern... he could already be loose! He will kill me and keep [ITEM]'s soul, I am sure of it! Getting inside the cavern is not a problem. I... paid the guard there what little money I have left. I had thought to... try and get [ITEM]'s soul myself. But the guard will let in whomever I ask him to. I have no coin left to offer you. I have bankrupted myself in trying to flee the lich's reach. But... [ENEMY] himself is a powerful wizard. Surely he has items that would interest you, that you could take from him!"
"Welcome to this [PLACE]. I've looked forward to seeing you. I am, as you know, [CHARACTER]. Strange things are afoot on the docks. Shipments are disappearing, as are my employees with them. We are significantly weakened by this. I think it unlikely you would be captured or wooed to the [ENEMY]. If you go to the docks and bolster the guard on the shipments, it will strengthen our position. Go at night, and you will find my present guard captain there already, a woman by the name of [CHARACTER]. Take note of anything odd that happens. Good hunting. Report to me if anything happens. Oh, and the reward I have set aside for you... I'll let you have some magical [ITEM]s. You will find them useful, I am sure."
"Two of our men, [CHARACTER] and [CHARACTER] by name, are planning to leave our little community and join with our [ENEMY]. Greener grass and all of that, I suppose. They are to meet their contact on the second floor of the Five Flagons tavern in the Bridge District. Go there and pose as one of our [ENEMY]'s new recruits. I want to know where our [ENEMY]'s lair is. We have yet to find it. This recruiter could arrive at any time so I suggest that you go to the Five Flagons now. They may prove unreasonable, so prepare yourself for hostility. <SOA>Return when you have the information we need<EOA>."

"Traveler, I'm worried about my fellow villagers here in the [PLACE]. I don't think that they eat enough nutritious, tasty [ITEM]. Could you help me gather more? I simply can't catch enough [ITEM] for everyone, even if I'm a pro fisherman. There is a river, [PLACE], bountiful in [ITEM] near here. You could try your luck there, and <SOA>catch [NUMBER] [ITEM] for me<EOA>. <SOA>I could pay you [NUMBER] [ITEM] for the [ITEM]<EOA>."
"Some incredibly foolish individual's been throwing [ITEM] all over our [PLACE]! Now the whole place is crawling with [ENEMY]! Could you take care of those little critters before they cause any serious issues? <SOA>Kill them all<EOA>, and receive [NUMBER] [ITEM] for your trouble. You would have all our thanks, too."
"Hail friend! It's good to see you. I'd offer you something to drink, but I'm running low on refreshments, and quite thirsty myself. We are in a [PLACE], after all. There's not much water around... Now that I think of it... <SOA>You could actually help the whole [PLACE] by obtaining us a permanent source of water!<EOA> Build us a well, please. Ahh, I can already taste the fresh water on my lips... I could give you this bucket of lava in exchange for a well. Just don't do anything mischievous with it, or burn yourself!"
"What are YOU doing here! If it was up to me, I'd never let you in the [PLACE]. Perhaps you'd like to mend our relations? Bring me some [ITEM] ore, the more the better. You can never have enough of it; it's so beautiful. My [ITEM]. I wish to have it all to myself. Too bad it's mainly found in the ore veins deep in the ground. I guess you could have these [ITEM] seeds as a reward. I have no use for them; [ITEM] have nothing on [ITEM]."
"My child, my temple could use a donation. I have to tend the sick and needy: I cannot procure all my potion ingredients myself. I often have to participate in rather complicated trades for the ingredients. Please, help a humble servant of the Gods: bring me [NUMBER] [ITEM]s. I know that they are rare, but <SOA>you can find still find them in ancient ruins<EOA>, and even deep within the Overworld itself. I have a vast surplus of some potion ingredients that cannot be traded further: I can give you [NUMBER] Glowstone Dust for your time and effort."
"I'm sick and tired of eating the same boring, mundane [ITEM] every day. I want to taste something a bit more refined. Something like golden [ITEM]. Could you help a lady in distress? Bring me [NUMBER] golden [ITEM] to sample from, and I'll procure you a [ITEM] block. That should leave a sweet taste in your mouth, as well. Golden [ITEM] can be found in various dangerous corners of the world. If you don't fancy exploring, you can craft golden [ITEM] by combining an [ITEM] with [ITEM] ingots."
"I'd like to redecorate my home. Stranger, <SOA>could you do a man a favor? Obtain [NUMBER]<EOA> red banners and bring them to me. I have heard that you can craft banners from sticks and [ITEM]. I'll have [NUMBER] [ITEM] for you."
"You must be the hero I have heard so much about. I have a small task for you; it should be child's play for one such as yourself. There is someone I really care about. I'd like to gift them some flowers, perhaps some of those nice, deep red [ITEM]. Please, <SOA>bring me [NUMBER] [ITEM]<EOA>. You can gather them almost everywhere outdoors in plains and forests. I'll have [NUMBER] emeralds waiting for you..."
"I want to make my leather works more... dashing and colorful. <SOA>Bring me [NUMBER] cyan dye<EOA>, and I'll reward you with [NUMBER] emeralds. You can make cyan dye by combining green dye with blue dye, I think. I'd obtain the dye myself, but the smell of my tanning chemicals attracts all sorts of unsavory [ENEMY] to me out there."
"My friend, as you might know, I'm not a [CHARACTER] to say no to the sweeter temptations in life. I'd be overjoyed if you baked me a delicious cake and brought it to me. I'm not leaving you hanging either: I have [NUMBER] golden apples for you."
"Great timing, Hero. I'm suffering... my poor heart is writhing in love. Help me find a rose for my loved one, so that my heart may yet calm down. All I need is but a single rose. They can be found in various temperate forests. Please, <SOA>help a fellow in love<EOA>. I have [NUMBER] pumpkin pies I can give you."
"I know of your dark deeds. I do not want any trouble from you. However... if you have had a change of heart, I could use a little help. The hot desert air of this [PLACE] is making me rather uncomfortable. I could stave off the heat if I had some ice. Tell you what, <SOA>bring me ice<EOA>, and you may still redeem yourself, villain, and net yourself [NUMBER] cacti. Ice is commonplace in snowy tundras, in frosted rivers."
"Dear friend, this [PLACE] is freezing cold, isn't it? This cold is turning my fingers blue, at least. You are a highly skilled individual. May I ask you to craft a campfire or two? First, you have to collect some materials: [NUMBER] sticks, a piece of coal, and [NUMBER] wood logs. After crafting the campfires, <SOA>please give them to me<EOA>. I even have something for you: [NUMBER] Blue Ice. It's slippery, blue-colored ice. I'm sure it'll prove useful to you, my friend."
"You are the [CHARACTER] who's been causing trouble in these parts, aren't you? Why don't we put your energy to a better use? I'm a mason, which means that I have to move large quantities of stone from one [PLACE] to another. I'd like to automate that process with pistons. That would save me from backache. The problem is I don't have the materials for making pistons, or the know-how to craft them. This is where you enter the picture. <SOA>Craft [NUMBER] pistons, and then bring them to me<EOA>. I know that you need [NUMBER] wooden planks, [NUMBER] cobblestone, an iron ingot, and Redstone Dust for crafting a piston. Some quarts pillars broke while we were transporting them. You could have the remaining [NUMBER] Nether Quartz from them."
"Gee! You okay? looks at you with a blank expression You look a dark [CHARACTER]-thing. Me think me know the right think to cheer you up! A quest. Me want one of those music disc thingies. <SOA>Find one?<EOA> Get [NUMBER] blocks of emerald in return."
"Me hurt me often. Other [CHARACTER] suggest me get a helmet to protect me head. Me seen turtles on sandy [PLACE]s. They never get hurt, because they hide in thick shells. <SOA>You give me a turtle shell?<EOA> <SOA>Make me safe?<EOA> Me give you this sharp stick in return. It a [ITEM] sword. It pretty, but me hurt plenty after touching it."
"I've been pondering about something. [PLACE] legends tell that [ENEMY]s drop something very peculiar when killed by skeletons. I have heard that you are a helpful person. <SOA>Could you perhaps collect that [ITEM] and report back to me?<EOA> You just have to figure out how to get a skeleton kill a [ENEMY]. This might be a difficult task to accomplish. You will be rewarded accordingly: [NUMBER] blocks of diamond. Surely you too are curious about what happens."
"No! Go away! Please don't kill me... [ENEMY]s are making me scared enough already! Perhaps you'd like to do something villainous, and even net a reward for it? This [PLACE], Fishing Hamlet, has been threatened by nearby [ENEMY]s of Deepwood Tower for some time. <SOA>You could go to their tower in the woods<EOA> and <SOA>steal their plans<EOA>. <SOA>Bring the plans to me<EOA>, and I'll give you an enchanted sword as a reward. Just don't test its blade on me, please!"
"I am a farmer here in [PLACE] Settlement. Sometimes, I get a bountiful harvest of melons. I process most of the melons into glistering melon slices for clerics and their important healing [ITEM]s. I actually just finished preparing some glistering melon slices. <SOA>Could you please take them to the cleric in the [PLACE] of Humming Hills?<EOA> I'm sure she'll pay you for them."
"I used to be an adventurer. I braved the depths of this world like no one else before me. I still have one of my healing [ITEM]s as a memento from those days of glory. That [ITEM] is quite special... Now that I think of it, the local cleric, Pope, might want to examine it for its peculiar properties. He could make some potent healing [ITEM]s after researching my special [ITEM]. <SOA>Could you please find him and give him the [ITEM]?<EOA> The cleric will surely give you a small compensation fee."
"I need the help of an outsider. I think one of the villagers here works for [ENEMY]s in secret! They could be planning an attack on Desert Refuge! <SOA>Would you please investigate this matter for me?<EOA> Try to obtain Suspicious Man's journal. It should shed light on his actions. I'm even willing to reward you with [NUMBER] emeralds. What are a few gems to peace of mind?"
"My daddy said that [CHARACTER]s and [CHARACTER]s can make babies together. I want to see what their babies look like! You are a grown-up! You ought to know how to tame and breed animals. Please show me a baby [CHARACTER]! I have seen both [CHARACTER]s and [CHARACTER]s eating grass an plains and savannas. <SOA>Try to tame one of both and make them breed!<EOA> <SOA>Show me a baby [CHARACTER]<EOA>, and I'll give you some golden [ITEM]s. They're incredibly tasty... and so shiny!"
"I have a task for you, stranger. And I'm willing to give you something precious in return. There are age-old tales of strong, volcanic glass. This glass is known as [ITEM]. I'd love to try out my masonry on [ITEM]! The tales also say that you can make [ITEM] by directing water on lava pools. There are many such pools underground in deep [PLACE]s. I would ask you to mine out some [ITEM] blocks for me. I'm not built for adventure myself: carving stones is all I know."]"
"I've caught a mountain of [ITEM] and [ITEM]. Yet, there are still some more exotic [ITEM] that have eluded my [ITEM] rod. Traveler, do you like [ITEM]ing? May I ask you to catch [NUMBER] tropical [ITEM] for me? These sort of [ITEM] are common in vast oceans of our [PLACE]. I yearn to take a look at new kinds of [ITEM]. I could even try to breed them. <SOA>If you happen to give me [NUMBER] exotic [ITEM]<EOA>, I'll be glad to reward you with an enchanted [ITEM] rod of mine. A best kind of tool for a passionate [ITEM]."
"I've been told that there are [CHARACTER]s in all possible colors; not just black, gray, white and brown. I'm not the sharpest [CHARACTER] around. You seem like a clever person: perhaps you know how to find these colorful [CHARACTER]s. [CHARACTER]s love grass; they tend to stay in grassy [PLACE]s. Let me have some colorful, beautiful [CHARACTER]s. I want to test breeding a flock of [CHARACTER]s in all colors of the rainbow. I'll let you have a pile of regular ole white [ITEM]."
"The ship sank. All those poor [CHARACTER]s have now passed the veil to the other side. This is a sad day for us all. My friend, that ship carried important [ITEM] ingredient for our [PLACE]. Most of the goods that are not produced here are transported here by the sea. Now I can't fashion remedies for our villagers, and the next shipment will not be here for a long time. You are a good person. I ask you to <SOA>find a bundle of life-saving [ITEM] ingredients for me<EOA>. That would mean a lot for the whole [PLACE]! The bundle should be in the sunken ship east of here. Here, this [ITEM] of water breathing should help you dive to the ship save and sound. I'll even let you have my old, extra brewing stand as a gift upon your return. Be careful while you dive; there a many lethal things lurking beneath the waves. I'd hate to bury a friend."
"Oh... You're that dark [ENEMY]. This is just like one of my adventure novels! So exciting! Perhaps you happen to know Spook. He's a kooky novelist who lives in an igloo to the north. You should get along with him splendidly! And whole you are there, you <SOA>could even get his new book for me<EOA>. I need to know what events unfold in that one! Evil machinations need funding, don't they? Well, do my little book-fetching mission, and gain an enchanted book. I love books, but that one flew over my head... literally!."
"I just escaped with my life from a friggin' Elder [ENEMY], and now I run into you, my least favorite person in the whole world. The damn Elder [ENEMY] swallowed the hook, line, and sinker of my [ITEM] rod while I was out in the sea [ITEM]ing on my boat. It must have eaten the whole [ITEM] rod after it slipped from my grip into the sea. I shouldn't have gone [ITEM] so close to the ocean monument far south of this [PLACE]. I just couldn't see the turquoise stones that make up the monument before it was too late. Who even built those dangerous underwater temples anyway? I have a proposition for you: recover my [ITEM] rod from the Elder [ENEMY], and I'll set you up with enough cooked [ITEM] to last your lifetime. We might even become friends. First, you have to <SOA>find the Elder [ENEMY]<EOA>, and <SOA>kill it<EOA>. Elder [ENEMY]s are one-eyed, large, pale, evil pufferfish. They can shoot laser, and make you fatigued when you get close to them."
"[ITEM]s are awesome! I love everything about them! Their texture, their taste... Some travelers claim to have seen some huge, giant [ITEM]s that stand as tall as trees. I want to see one for real! Could you help me see a huge [ITEM]? You are a traveler: you must know how to grow huge [ITEM]s. Please find a regular [ITEM] from a [PLACE] shielded from direct sunlight, and find a way to grow it into a huge [ITEM] somewhere where I can see it. Report <SOA>back to me after growing a huge [ITEM]<EOA>, and <SOA>I'll reward you with a bunch of golden carrots<EOA>. They are tasty, but I prefer [ITEM]s. Especially steamy, hot [ITEM] stew that waters one's mouth."
"My job is to sell [ITEM] of all sorts: both cooked and raw. I take pride in my craftsmanship: I always try to find new, improved ways to cook [ITEM]. I have a hypothesis: the fuel used in my oven affects the taste of the [ITEM] that's cooked in it. I'd like to test out different materials to feed the flames of my oven: a bucket of [ITEM], a blaze rod, and a block of [ITEM], for starters. Would you help a butcher better her craft? Bring the items I mentioned to me, and I'll cook you a year's worth of steak. [ITEM] can be found in pools deep under the ground. I'll give you a bucket for scooping out the [ITEM]. Blaze rods a trickier to obtain; you have to brave the hellscape that is the [PLACE]. [ITEM], on the contrary, is quite easy to get. Just <SOA>look out for ore veins seated in stone<EOA>."
"My friend, I've got a profitable deal for you today. As you know, I smith weapons from a variety of materials, including diamond. Just so it happens, I'm running low on [ITEM]s: soon I can't make any diamond swords for daring adventurers. I'm not skilled in adventuring; I can't brave the deep underground for diamond veins. Yet, I have a whopping block of Netherite. You definitely don't see those every day! Here's the deal: <SOA>bring me [NUMBER] blocks of diamond<EOA>, and I'll give you my block of Netherite. A good deal for a good friend."
"Me useless moron, say many people of this [PLACE]. Me want to seem like a hero instead. Would make I happier, less thinking of dying. Me know!!! Go to The End. That strange [PLACE] at the end. <SOA>Kill that big meanie [ENEMY]<EOA>. Tell I how you did it, and me can tell everyone me did it! Me give you something cool for me white lie."
"I want to become famous. Just not quite like you, hero. I seek to become the best armorer in the world. To do that, I need a lot of practice in hammering down pieces of armor. Would you please bring me [NUMBER] blocks of iron? Those should help me become a better armorer in no time! First, you have to <SOA>get iron ore from the many iron veins in the [PLACE]<EOA>. Next, you'll want to <SOA>smelt the ore into iron ingots in a furnace somewhere<EOA>. Lastly, you ought to craft those iron ingots into blocks of iron on a crafting table. <SOA>Do all that<EOA>, and I promise to outfit you in better armor than what you are wearing now!"
"I really want to see something more interesting than the bounds of this [PLACE]. That would also elevate my status among the other villagers. Traveler, can you take me to the Nether? I want see that hellish realm myself, but I can't fend off its dangers all by myself. Let us explore the place together. You will also get a fair reward for being my guide in the Nether: [NUMBER] diamonds. Don't spend them all at once."
"The guys in this [PLACE] rarely take note of me. I want to dye my hair red to make myself more attractive. Wandering traders often have red dye. <SOA>Could you find some [ITEM]<EOA> and <SOA>give it to me?<EOA> I'd give you [NUMBER] emeralds for the red dye."
"No one in this [PLACE] buys the beautiful stones cut by me. I'm a failure of a mason! [CHARACTER], could you promote my stoneworks? I really could use more customers. This [PLACE] is quite large, there ought to be at least a few villagers who might be interested in my stone bricks and other stoneworks. Just hand out some promotional pamphlets to the villagers of Stoneburg. You'll even net a load of emeralds for your services, my [CHARACTER]."
"I am most certainly not going to sing your praises, you nasty [ENEMY]. On the contrary, it would be music to my ears if you helped me reach my musical ambitions. No one in this [PLACE] seems to care for music, or any of the arts for that matter. For starters, obtain [NUMBER] note blocks. It has to be exactly [NUMBER], because there are that many different notes to play. It's possible to craft note blocks from wooden planks and redstone dust. <SOA>Bring the [NUMBER] note blocks to me<EOA>. I'll let you have an old music disc of mine."
"I want all [ENEMY] in this [PLACE] know how much I hate them. Perhaps I could get some of their heads to show my disdain toward them. [ENEMY] heads should show all [ENEMY]s that I am not to be trifled with. You will certainly help me; many people in this [PLACE] have told me that you are a resourceful and eager to work. Bring me five [ENEMY] heads. Powerful [ENEMY]s are somehow related to getting the heads, but I don't know how exactly. <SOA>Get me the heads<EOA>, and I'll give you wings that let you soar the skies: an Elytra."
"[CHARACTER] is dead, just like all the others. You continue to impress me, Silencer, and I am only too eager to indulge your homicidal instincts. Your next target is a savage [ENEMY] barbarian, living alone and exposed at a small campsite on the summit of [PLACE] Mountain. This barbarian, [CHARACTER] by name, savagely butchered the chieftain of a mead hall on the island of [PLACE]. The chieftain's sister has forgone the [ENEMY] custom of extracting the monetary retribution of wergild, and instead wants [CHARACTER] to pay with his life. You, dear Silencer, will help put her family at peace. You are to <SOA>go to [PLACE] Mountain<EOA>, <SOA>locate [CHARACTER]<EOA>, and send <SOA>his soul to the great beyond<EOA>. When [CHARACTER] has been executed, journey to the ancient ruin of [PLACE]. In the flooded section of that ruin, you will find a chest, submerged in the water. As you may have guessed, the chest contains your reward for killing [CHARACTER], [NUMBER] gold, and your next contract."
"I'm [CHARACTER], the Count's butler. So you want to buy a house? I can speak for the Count. [PLACE] Hall is a stately manor currently occupied by [CHARACTER]. You won't find a better property for sale in [PLACE]. It's just inside the main gate, near the bridge to the chapel. The house costs [NUMBER] septims. Give me the septims, and I will order the deed to the house drawn up. Don't worry about [CHARACTER]. I'll have him evicted. I'm sure he'll find another home easily."
"It is a pleasure to meet you. I am [CHARACTER] of [PLACE]. Are you looking for a house to buy? There is a positively gorgeous home for sale right on the main plaza. You'll be hard pressed to find a nicer home for sale in [PLACE]. The house is called [PLACE], and it costs [NUMBER] gold to buy the house from me. It would be a pleasure to have you become a citizen of [PLACE]. The last tenant of [PLACE] has cleaned the place of furniture. I'd recommend stopping by [PLACE] Goods and Trade. The owner, [CHARACTER], should have everything you need."
"I'm [CHARACTER]. I'm sorry to impose upon you like this, but I'm in need of assistance, and I don't know what to do. My husband, [CHARACTER], is missing. It all started when [CHARACTER] became foolish and started gambling. He'd visit the arena every week and spend our hard-earned money on bets. I told him to stop, but he didn't listen. He was certain he could win us a fortune and move us somewhere nicer, like the [PLACE]. It didn't take long for [CHARACTER] to begin losing. He resorted to borrowing money from a usurer to cover his losses and place new bets. As you can imagine, it didn't pay off. He ended up owing around [NUMBER] gold. We could never have that kind of money to pay back the usurer. Yesterday, the usurer, [CHARACTER] gro, sent for my husband to meet him at the [PLACE]. He hasn't returned since. I fear for his life. [CHARACTER] isn't known for his patience. Please, I'm not wealthy, but I'd give anything to see [CHARACTER] again. Please, <SOA>find [CHARACTER]<EOA>. Farewell, and be careful, [CHARACTER] is not to be trusted."
"I am [CHARACTER] of [PLACE]. I wish I had time to chat, but I'm afraid I am in the middle of an investigation. You seem the trusting type. Perhaps you can assist me? It seems someone has taken away an heirloom that is quite dear to me. I want you to help me recover a stolen painting. The painting was of my lost love, the [CHARACTER], and it has been stolen from my bedchamber. If you <SOA> the painting and bring the culprit to justice<EOA>, you shall be justly rewarded. I suggest you begin to gather clues. And I warn you: do not accuse the wrong person, or I shall be quite cross with you. Here are some keys. They should allow you access to many of the restricted areas in Castle [PLACE]."
"[CHARACTER], Count of [PLACE]. So you're looking for a house to buy here in [PLACE]? Really? It just so happens there is a modest shack overlooking the canal. It's not much to look at, but the smell will soon make you forget how ugly it is. Pay me [NUMBER] gold, and it's all yours. I'll have my steward register the deed of ownership. It's a squalid little shack, I'm sorry to say. Oh, and the place is fairly bare. If I were you, I'd <SOA>head on over to [CHARACTER] at The [PLACE]<EOA> and <SOA>get some furnishings<EOA>. Or you could always eat off the floor... doesn't matter to me."
"[CHARACTER], Office of Imperial Commerce. You desire a house in the Imperial City? Why? I mean... of course. All I have available right now is a hovel on the Waterfront. It's yours for a mere [NUMBER] septims. You may give those septims to me. You'll find the house in the Waterfront District. It's not much to look at. You may want to spruce it up a bit with some furnishings. I'd suggest talking to [CHARACTER] at Three Brothers Trade Goods in the Market District."
"About time someone showed up. Thank you for freeing me. I'm [CHARACTER] gro, the [PLACE]'s bouncer and helmsman. I've been locked in that storage room for hours. I don't know exactly what's going on, but not long ago, a gang of thieves calling themselves The [ENEMY] stormed the ship. They took myself and [CHARACTER], the [PLACE]'s owner, hostage and put the ship to sea. I have no idea what they're after. If you can get me safely to the top deck, I can steer the [ENEMY] home. But I'm not budging until the coast is clear. I'm used to dealing with drunken louts, not a gang of well-armed [ENEMY]. Good luck... you'll need it."
"Hail knight! I am [CHARACTER] Whitestrake, whose Relics you seek with a worthy heart! Your prayers have woken me from my endless dream. Or perhaps you have entered my dream, and I still sleep. I think others have sometimes spoken to me, others like you, but my memory is doubtful. Perhaps the others came after you. Your need must be great for the gods to allow us to speak. Has [ENEMY] the Accursed found a way back? The foulest of a foul race. A thousand curses upon his unholy name! I thought I'd won. But I should have known. The [ENEMY] are a cunning breed. [ENEMY] found a way to cheat death, as I could not. If you would seek for my Relics, I know little that can help you. All that has passed since my death is like mist that my mind cannot take hold of. My friends built a shrine upon the site of my death, [PLACE], where the [ENEMY] tormented me in a final act of revenge. I can show you where it once stood. Perhaps it is there still. Fare thee well, sir knight. May the gods grant you to destroy [ENEMY] utterly, as I failed to do."
"Hear my final passings of praise and wisdom! You have stepped from the humble shadows of obscurity and into legend. No feat you have accomplished in your life compares to what you have become. You are an embodiment of [CHARACTER] Whitestrake, the bane of [ENEMY] the Unfeathered. The time has come for you to fulfill your destiny. [ENEMY] lies hid in the ancient fane of Garlas Malatar. You must go there and destroy him. [ENEMY]'s Daedric nature allows his spirit to escape into Oblivion after death. This is what [CHARACTER] learned upon defeating [ENEMY] the first time. You must first kill his living body. While beyond the power of most mortals, this is only the lesser of your two tasks. It will allow you to <SOA>follow [ENEMY] into the spirit realm upon his death<EOA>. It will allow you to destroy him, body and soul, utterly and for all time."
"I am [CHARACTER] Ulven, a botanist. You're offering to help me with my research? Well... I suppose I could find a use for you, despite your lack of training. Collect some plants for me, will you? Here's the list of things I need. Get me everything on it. <SOA>Try to remember where you found it so you can tell me<EOA>. It's important. I will pay you [NUMBER] gold coins for each sample."
"I am [CHARACTER], Chamberlain to the Lord [CHARACTER]. You approach the [PLACE]. Through the door behind me lies the realm of [CHARACTER], Prince of Madness, Lord of the Never-There. My Lord seeks a mortal to act as His Champion. Perhaps the Lord [CHARACTER] will find a use for you. You'll want to pass through the Gates of Madness. Oh, and mind the Gatekeeper. He dislikes strangers to the Realm."
"By the strength and guidance of the Nine, who comes before us upon this sacred [PLACE] seeking the [ITEM] of the Divine [CHARACTER]? Step forward, adventurer, and face us, the [CHARACTER]s of the Nine, each in honorable combat. For the vows we failed to revere in life, we shall uphold in death. No unworthy soul shall lay hands upon this sacred [ITEM] without the leave of the [CHARACTER]s of the Nine."
"Excuse me. I'm innkeeper [CHARACTER]. We have a small problem that we hope you can help us with. You may be wondering why you can't see me. We are all wondering the same thing. Everyone in [PLACE] suddenly became invisible several weeks ago. It was sort of fun at first, but the novelty has definitely worn off now. You can imagine how difficult it is to run an inn while invisible. Once you get a reputation as a haunted inn, you can just forget about it. So we've all been keeping quiet, hoping the spell will wear off. But we're running out of patience. We're sure it was [ENEMY]'s doing, but we can't find him. If you can help us, we will be extremely grateful. [ENEMY]'s a [CHARACTER] who took up residence in the ruins of [PLACE] a couple of years ago. He's caused us no end of trouble with his magical experiments, but nothing as bad as this. We've tried to find him, but had no luck. If he's still living in the fort, he's hiding from us, and no wonder. If you could find him and get him to remove this cursed invisibility, we will all be in your debt. The ruined fort is just to the southeast of here. Follow the path down the hill. But watch out for the invisible [ENEMY]s that infest the ruins! If you make us visible again, you'd be welcome at the [PLACE] Inn anytime. Free of charge."
"Oh my. To what do I owe this honor? I am but a humble [CHARACTER]. What business do you have with me? You would quest for the holy panoply of [CHARACTER]? The legendary Relics that have been sought by mighty warriors throughout the ages? Are you a worthy knight? The gods grant insight to those they deem worthy. Why and how they act is not predictable. What I can tell you is that traditionally, knights who wished to quest for the Relics would walk the Pilgrim's Way. Travel to the Wayshrines of the Nine Divines. Pray to each of the gods in turn, and ask their favor upon your quest."
"These stupid [ENEMY]s are driving me crazy! I'm at my wit's end! I, [CHARACTER], beg you to help me! The beastly little creatures are nasty, smelly, noisy and wrecking my beautiful house! I must be rid of them! I can't let people know I have [ENEMY]s in here, or they'll think I've taken to Daedra worship. Try explaining that to the town guard. I had a feeling buying that Daedric [ITEM] would be trouble. Now I'm paying for it with more than just some gold. A few weeks ago, a spellsword was passing through [PLACE] and heard that I like to buy curiosities. He wanted to sell the [ITEM] you see me carrying. I eagerly bought it, knowing the value of Daedric relics. In fact, I was a bit suspicious when he sold it so cheap. His loss, my gain I figured. After examining it for a bit I noticed a small word carved on it in runes. Using a book from my library, I translated it. The word was nonsense. However, when I spoke it and held the [ITEM], four [ENEMY]s suddenly appeared! I thought I was done for! Strangely, they all just stood there. It didn't take long before I realized they were following me! I couldn't be seen in town with [ENEMY]s following, so I decided to discard the [ITEM]. I can't explain it, but somehow I can't compel myself to actually let it go. This [ITEM] is obviously cursed! Now I'm stuck with it. Oh please, I beg you! Take this [ITEM] to [PLACE] Cave and get rid of it and the [ENEMY]s forever! I can't fight, and who knows what's guarding the shrine? Plus, do you know how dirty caves are? It'll ruin anything I wear! Do this for me, and I'll reward you with another one of my curios I picked up a few years ago... a valuable [ITEM]. [ITEM] of Eidolon's Edge."
"I'm [CHARACTER]. You wouldn't happen to be in the market for a home would you? If you are, I just happen to be selling a manor located right here in [PLACE]. I'm selling my grandfather's house, [CHARACTER] Manor. If you're interested, I could let you have it for a modest sum, [NUMBER] gold. I have to sell it soon, as I have pressing matters elsewhere. You're welcome to take a look at it. It is located across the street from the [PLACE]. Once you buy, you get the key to the front door and the deed of ownership. That's the deal."
"Do you like parties? Because you've been invited to one. Of course you'll be killing all the other guests. Each guest, at some point in the past, wronged their mysterious host. Now he's hired us to exact his revenge. Are you ready to attend? You need to go to the city of [PLACE], to the large house known as [PLACE] Manor. There you will meet up with five very unlucky guests. In order to receive your bonus, you must kill each guest secretly, one by one. If anyone sees you committing murder, the bonus is forfeit. The guests believe there is a chest of [ITEM] hidden in the house, and have agreed to be locked inside until one of them finds it. In fact, the guests believe the key to the manor is inside the chest, and only by satisfying their greed will they be allowed to leave. Poor fools. There is, of course, no chest of [ITEM]. The guests will find no key. After you arrive, the doors will be locked behind you, as everyone expects. When all the guests lie dead, you will be free to leave. Now go, see the doorman at [PLACE] Manor. He will explain the rest. Have fun."
"Warmest greetings to you. I am [CHARACTER]. I'm eager to see how you fare on your first assignment. Go to the [PLACE] District of the Imperial City. There you will find a ship named the Marie Elena. Board the ship and find its captain, [CHARACTER]. He'll be in his cabin. Eliminate [CHARACTER] in any manner you see fit. As a pirate, [CHARACTER] has certainly spilled his share of blood. Someone wants revenge, and they've hired us to extract it. The pirates have been moving a lot of cargo onboard lately. You may be able to smuggle yourself onboard in one of the packing crates. Oh, and one more thing. Get into the habit of asking your fellow assassins about any current contract. Their insight may prove invaluable."
"Hello again. It's me, [CHARACTER]. Good to see that you're looking for more work. There's certainly more to be done. I need you to help [CHARACTER] of [PLACE]. [CHARACTER] is a scholar, interested in researching Daedra worship. Meet her in [PLACE] Cave, <SOA>help her find the shrine<EOA>, and <SOA>keep her safe<EOA>.""[CHARACTER]" into a dense forest rumored to be haunted by an ancient curse.

"I was sent here to lead the [PLACE]'s interests in this corner of the world. It's my mission to root out all Talos worship in this [PLACE]. You're awfully inquisitive, aren't you? I like that. Perhaps you'd care to solve a little problem I'm having? [CHARACTER] the Skald. [CHARACTER]'s old, respected, and I know for a fact that [CHARACTER] worships Talos in [CHARACTER]'s home. But the Jarl has been hesitant to call for [CHARACTER]'s arrest. <SOA>I want you to break in to [CHARACTER]'s home<EOA> and <SOA>find evidence<EOA>."
"After everything you've already done for [PLACE], I hate to ask for more but I can't risk Councilor [CHARACTER] being killed. The [CHARACTER] Family of [HOUSE] [HOUSE], a rival Great House, has placed a deathmark on the Councilor's head. I need you to start out by being my eyes and ears... search [PLACE] and see if you can root out these traitors. The best place to start would be [CHARACTER] Sadri over at the [PLACE] Cornerclub. If [CHARACTER] provides you any leads, <SOA>check them out before bringing them to my attention<EOA>. I can't afford to make any mistakes."
"I'm [CHARACTER]. Are you here to help? I've finally located [ENEMY]'s crypt! The [ITEM] I'm looking for just has to be here. Maybe you could help find it, I just know it's in here. [ENEMY] is some old priest buried here long ago. I've been searching for [ENEMY]'s tomb for a few years now. If [ENEMY] is as powerful as I think, <SOA>I may need a little help um... dealing with [ENEMY]<EOA>. With the two of us this should be easy. You can have anything except the [ITEM] of course. It's probably meaningless to you, but according to family legend it links our bloodline back to [CHARACTER]."
"The [CHARACTER]-Bloods are trying to muscle in on my land. [ENEMY] attack the mines, and suddenly all these sellswords show up in [PLACE] to 'help.' They won't let anyone work until I sell it off. <SOA>You can try to convince them to leave<EOA>, but I'd keep your sword-arm ready if things get ugly."
"Ah, there you are. I have a job for you. [ENEMY]-Ei is our inside man at the [PLACE] Empire Company in [PLACE]. I'm betting [ENEMY] acted as a go-between for the sale of [PLACE] Estate and that [ENEMY] can finger our buyer. Get out there, shake [ENEMY] down and see what you come up with. <SOA>Talk to [CHARACTER]<EOA> before you leave if you have any questions."
"I believe I am, yes. Technically speaking, of course. The [PLACE] is also home to a priest, a priestess, an alchemist, and I'm sure others who practice. Ah, that reminds me. Speaking of alchemists, I have some frost salts for [CHARACTER]. [CHARACTER] asked me to obtain them for one of [CHARACTER] potions. <SOA>Would you be so kind as to deliver the frost salts for me?<EOA> I'm sure [CHARACTER] will provide some form of recompense…"
"The roads to the mines and to the other cities are thick with [ENEMY]... and worse. Would you be interested in gathering some materials for me? I'd certainly be happy to compensate you. I'm seeking a small list of items to complete my next creation: two flawless sapphires, a mammoth tusk and a chunk of [ITEM] ore."
"Sad, isn't it? We can't afford to keep the place running since these attacks started. [ENEMY], you see. Raiding all along the coast, from Hammerfell to Vvardenfell. Our own security forces are limited, and all the mercenaries are tied up in this ridiculous war. We don't even know their base of operations, and attacking single ships won't really solve the problem. Only the [CHARACTER]-Shields appear safe. They are a very powerful family here in [PLACE]. They run a private shipping operation, and would love to have the docks to themselves. Wouldn't surprise me if they were in league with [ENEMY], somehow. Not yet, no. But perhaps an intrepid person such as yourself could help with that. They have a dark elf who oversees their operations. [CHARACTER] Atheron. She's meticulous to a fault, and keeps a logbook with every transaction [CHARACTER] makes. <SOA>If you get me the logbook<EOA>, I'll have proof of [CHARACTER]-Shield's treachery."
"I'm going to make this short and sweet, because frankly I don't think you deserve another shot. You've broken the rules and now you need to pay... and it's going to cost you quite a bit: [NUMBER] gold. You claim to be a thief... act like one. Pick pockets, knock over houses... heck, I don't care if you have to bust into a palace. You do what you have to do to come up with the coin. <SOA>Anything you steal, you bring it straight to me<EOA>. Now get out of here and don't come back until your pockets are full. Only then you're one of us again."
"That damn fool! I should wring [CHARACTER]'s neck! That fool student of mine stole my flute and sold it to some necromancer in [PLACE] Cave. Apparently [CHARACTER] told him some story about the flute being able to make the dead dance. It's just a flute. A really old and valuable flute, but just a flute. I just got a ransom note for it. That flute has been handed down for [NUMBER] generations! Well, don't just stand there. <SOA>Go get my flute!<EOA> I don't have any money to give you. but I can show you a few tricks I learned playing for wizards."
"The [PLACE] Hand has been scouring the world for more pieces of [ITEM]. A group of their members has managed to secure one of the pieces. They have gone hidden out in [PLACE], somewhere inside [PLACE] Cavern. The piece of [ITEM] should be there with them. <SOA>Get that piece of [ITEM] back<EOA>, for the honor of us all."
"The [PLACE] seemed convinced the [ITEM] of [CHARACTER] was somewhere in [PLACE]. They inquired about the ruins of [PLACE], but that's all I remember. It sounded like they were heading there, though they were rather secretive about why. I suppose if you're intent on looking for the [ITEM], there's a chance they might be in [PLACE] yet. Just don't expect them to be cooperative."
"Look at you. Such a devoted student of [ITEM]. It's comforting to see that not everyone has dismissed it as entirely as most members of the [PLACE]. Truly comforting. It looks like you're ready to speak with the [CHARACTER]. [CHARACTER] was a brilliant mage. Truly inspired. Mastered spells others could barely comprehend. [CHARACTER] was especially gifted when it came to [ITEM]. The [CHARACTER]'s... Well, [CHARACTER]'s very particular about who shares the knowledge. So you'll need [CHARACTER]'s approval first. <SOA>Go on, go talk to [CHARACTER]<EOA>. I'm sure [CHARACTER]'s been paying attention, and will be expecting you."
"I need some more supplies. <SOA>Can you help out with that?<EOA> I'm running low on [ITEM]. <SOA>Bring me another seven of them, if you can<EOA>."
"What's going on here is that we've been kicked out of our home. The [ENEMY] Mead Hall, up there on the hill. We were... some [ENEMY] have taken it over. [ENEMY] overcame us with tenacity and numbers. Didn't help that we'd grown a little too comfortable up there. Too much mead. Too many stories. Too few battles. Are you... offering to help? Some new blood should be enough to rouse these layabouts to actually fight again."
"We've received a desperate missive. A citizen of the [PLACE] has been kidnapped. The [CHARACTER] have been asked for assistance, and we shall answer. Particularly when the pay is as good as this. Get moving. Find the kidnapped citizen at [PLACE]'s Tooth and save them. I shudder to think what might happen if you're too late. <SOA>Bring honor to the [CHARACTER] and yourself<EOA>."
"You're going to [PLACE] Neugrad. The [ENEMY] have some of our boys locked up there. But with a little luck, we can turn that to our advantage. I've sent some men to scout out the area. <SOA>Meet them near [PLACE]<EOA>, see if you can't find a way to slip in the fort, free our men, and take over the fort. They'll never suspect an attack from the inside. This won't be easy. But that's why I'm sending you. You got the grit to get this done?"
"I have watched you for some time, you know. The decisions you've made intrigue me, and I wonder if you are the proper agent for a task of mine. I sent a blessing to the world, a wasting plague that infected a scattering of [CHARACTER] villages. One of my monks, the elf [CHARACTER], was sent to gather these Afflicted. He shepherded them into [PLACE] for me, but has since lost his way. I will not stand for betrayal. I want you to <SOA>go to [PLACE]<EOA> and <SOA>kill [CHARACTER]<EOA>, in my name. I can grant you a powerful token for this task. An escutcheon of dwarven make, capable of shielding you from both the spell and sword. Return when the elf lies dead and it will be yours."
"Mining gear? No. However, I used to sell [ITEM] until I ran out of them. Popular little [ITEM]. It's an amulet that was made exclusively for the [PLACE] Company. They gave them to their workers as an incentive at one point... a kind of reward for extra effort. They're no longer being made, so they've become collectible. I'd love to get my hands on a few of them. They could be anywhere on the island. The mines might be a good place to start. <SOA>If you find any while you're exploring [PLACE], bring them here<EOA> and I'll pay you for them."
"Eager to make some coin, eh? That's the spirit. I'll tell you what. The Guild's got a problem out here that I've been trying to deal with for years, but haven't been able to handle. A fellow [CHARACTER] who went by the name [CHARACTER] Tyne showed up on my doorstep about a fortnight ago. He stole something from me: my own formula for improved [ITEM]. Took me years to perfect. Before he ran off, he was talking some nonsense about trying to fence goods to the [ENEMY] at [PLACE]. I told him he was crazy to even think about talking to those vicious little buggers, but he wouldn't listen. I'd bet a fat purse of coin that he's either dead or hiding out up there."
"I'm afraid there's a problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the [CHARACTER] leader really is. He's a dragon. Not just any dragon, but the right hand of [CHARACTER], responsible for many atrocities during the ancient Dragon War. It's true that his crimes are long in the past, but justice does not count the passage of years. Justice demands that he, [CHARACTER], dies for his crimes. Until he is dead, I'm afraid my oath as a Blade prevents me from offering you aid and comfort."
"There may be a matter in which your... skills... could be useful. The various points of focus for magic energies around the [PLACE] have become polluted, and need cleansing. As you may be aware, the [PLACE] has gone to great lengths to purify and enhance the natural energies of the world. This both enhances our connection to the realm of magic, and eliminates possible interference from outside sources. These energies, on occasion, become... polluted. Effort must be made to see that they are kept pure, clean. These specially enchanted [ITEM] will allow you to delve directly into the focal points for these energies. <SOA>Go to each focal point<EOA> and <SOA>remove whatever impurities you may find there<EOA>. <SOA>Return the [ITEM] to me when you have finished<EOA>. Please exercise caution. This is not a procedure without possible... consequences."
"I need your help with something. Something private. I may have entered into an... agreement with [CHARACTER]. He had something I needed, so I traded him something of mine. It was a mistake, and now I want back what I gave him. It's an [ITEM] that belonged to my family, and I never should've given it to [CHARACTER]. But he won't deal with me. <SOA>Talk to him<EOA>; <SOA>see what it'll take to get my [ITEM] back<EOA>."
"Been a while since I've seen one of those. What you've got there is a [ITEM] of [CHARACTER]. The [ITEM] was pried off of [CHARACTER]'s ceremonial crown by a thief in order to cover his tracks. I think there were [NUMBER] in all; supposedly, all of them are in [PLACE]. Most people keep them as a curiosity. Some of the Guild members have tried to locate them over the years, but they haven't been successful... well, until now. I only buy things I can turn around quickly for a profit. And no one wants those [ITEM] unless they have the whole set. Tell you what, <SOA>if you find the rest of them, talk to me again<EOA>. Otherwise, keep it and maybe it'll bring you luck."
"You're a traveler, correct? Have you been to [PLACE]? My daughter, [CHARACTER], was assigned to [PLACE] after she joined the Imperial Army. I was hoping you might have met her. I haven't heard from her lately. I've tried talking to Captain [CHARACTER] but he hasn't been any help. <SOA>It would be very sweet of you to get more information about my daughter<EOA>. Anything you can find out from Captain [CHARACTER] would be welcome news."
"You idiot. Do you even know who I am? The most recognized scholar on the [CHARACTER] in all of Tamriel, and you people keep bothering me! I... I'm sorry I... I got too excited. I'm in the middle of some very... stressful work, and I shouldn't have yelled. How can I help you? You want to access my [CHARACTER] museum? It's a private place where I can catalog my research. Occasionally, the nobles will come in and have questions, but that's thankfully rare. I'll let you in if you agree to something for me. There's a giant [ENEMY] in [PLACE], my excavation site. My workers call her 'Nimhe', the Poisoned One. <SOA>If you deal with [ENEMY], I'll let you into both the excavation site and my [CHARACTER] Museum<EOA>. What do you say?"
"You look like someone who can hold their liquor. How about a friendly contest to win a [ITEM]? Ha! So you think that I don't have a chance against you. We'll see about that. This is a special brew, very strong stuff. Let's get started."
"Wake up! That's right, it's time to wake up, you drunken blasphemer! Of course! You don't remember getting here. I'm guessing you also don't remember coming in here and blathering incoherently about marriage or a goat. Which means you don't remember losing your temper and throwing trash all over the [PLACE]. You want to know where your friend [CHARACTER] has gone? [CHARACTER] teaches love and compassion, but that doesn't mean we're just going to tell you what you want to know and let you walk away from this. Pick up your mess, then apologize, and if we think you're sincere we'll consider lending you aid."
"Well, well. Look at you. The authorities of [PLACE] have turned you into an animal. A wild beast caged up and left to go mad. So, my fellow beast, what do you want? Answers about the [ENEMY]? Revenge for trying to have you killed? You're one of us now, you see? A slave. The boot of the false, unjust law stepping on your throat. Maybe if you understood that, I could help you. There's a man named [CHARACTER] inside these mines. Besides me, he's been here the longest. <SOA>Tell him I sent you<EOA>. <SOA>Ask him why he's here<EOA>. <SOA>I want you to know how widespread the injustice of [PLACE] is<EOA>. Then, we might discuss about an early pardon."
"It seems you've inherited a problem. [CHARACTER] owes me [NUMBER] septims. At least he did until you set him up with that powerful wizard. Now he's untouchable. The way I figure it, it's your fault he can't pay me. So I guess I'm going to have to collect it from you. And if you don't pay me? Nothing for now. But watch your back. I'll be sending collectors to find you. They won't ask so nicely. One way or the other, I'll get my money. When you are tired of looking over your shoulder, you'll pay me."
"Ah, there you are. We've got some business to discuss. You must go to the [PLACE] of [PLACE], and speak with the apothecary's assistant. You'll probably find her in the shop, [PLACE]. The girl's been running her mouth, wants an ex-lover killed. She's apparently performed the Black Sacrament. Her name is [CHARACTER]. <SOA>I need you to talk to her, set up the contract, and carry it out<EOA>. Just do whatever the contact wishes. Be professional, represent us well, and get the job done. Since it's your first contract, I'll let you keep whatever [CHARACTER] pays. She'll be generous, I'm sure. They always are."
"Name's [CHARACTER]. I hunt out of [PLACE]. We tracked a [ENEMY] to this den, [PLACE]. Good coin for those pelts. We had the big sow cornered when they showed up. Three of them, out of nowhere. [ENEMY]. Niels went down before we even knew to run. Ari died just inside. I never even thought the things were real. But now what? I can't just walk away. Not with my friends' bodies in there, being torn apart by those [ENEMY].<SOA>You would help me clear out the [ENEMY]?<EOA> You'd do that for a stranger? I don't know what to say. Lead on, I suppose."
"I am in no mood to talk, outsider. One of the [PLACE] has gone missing. It is [CHARACTER] Iron-Shaper. As our only smith, [CHARACTER] is very important to the village. [CHARACTER] is the keeper of an ancient tradition, the forging of [ITEM]. It is an art we [PLACE] hold sacred. If someone wanted to make such weapons, they would have to get that knowledge from [CHARACTER]. I did see something in the woods on the day [CHARACTER] disappeared. I saw two elves in the far distance, dragging something behind them. Hunters often visit our lands, so I thought little of it. The elves went south and west. If your road takes you that way, perhaps you could search for any sign of [CHARACTER]. The [PLACE] would be grateful."
"Please, stranger! I need your help! Divine mercy - you aren't one of the [ENEMY]. Please, you've got to help me! It's my wife, [CHARACTER]! I think she's being held in this [PLACE]. Let me explain. [CHARACTER], my wife, left the farm on errands and never came back. It's been months, and I've been searching for her since. I heard a rumor that these [ENEMY] were ransoming captives, so I thought she may be here. I managed to sneak past the guards and get this far, but... I don't think I can go on. I'm no warrior! <SOA>Please, can you look for her?<EOA> I don't have much, but I can give you some coin for the trouble. One of the guards dropped this key while I hid. I wager it will come in handy for you. Please hurry!"
"Sorry, the [PLACE] Mine's dry right now. What's wrong with the mine, you might ask. It's full of [ENEMY], that's what's wrong with it! Almost killed [CHARACTER] and me when they showed up. I'm worried that they'll come out of the mine looking for food soon... then we're in even bigger trouble. <SOA>You'd clear them out for us?<EOA> Tell you what. Keep to your word, and I'll line your pockets with as much as I can scrape up."
"All I can think about is my [CHARACTER], my [CHARACTER]... they say that [CHARACTER] was killed, but I know better. I know my [CHARACTER] is alive! Those [ENEMY]-Born... they're in with the Imperials. They know it too, and yet they lie to my very face! It's not wise to discuss how I know about their lies here. <SOA>Please, if you truly wish to help, meet me at my [PLACE]<EOA>. I'll tell you the whole story."
"I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great import to Jarl [CHARACTER] of [PLACE]. We have it on good authority that [ENEMY] has raised enough men to attack the city of [PLACE]. The Jarl, however, refuses the Legion's support. This missive should convince him. Be aware soldier, these documents contain sensitive intelligence for the Jarl's eyes only."
"Welcome to the family, kid. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me. This is how you get your cut of the spoils. Do as you're told and keep your blade clean. We can't turn a profit by killing. <SOA>You should talk with [CHARACTER] and [CHARACTER]<EOA>. They know their way around this [PLACE] and they'll be able to kick some extra jobs your way. Oh, and <SOA>talk to [CHARACTER] in the [PLACE]<EOA>... she'll set you up with your new [ITEM]."
"There have been reports of weird happenings near [PLACE]. Travelers disappearing, odd lights. I suspect wild animals or perhaps [ENEMY]. The [PLACE] has a bad history. Long ago, [ENEMY] the Wolf Queen used it for necromantic rituals. That's where it got the name. That was over [NUMBER] years ago. Nothing much down there now - but everyone's always convinced the [PLACE] is haunted. I don't think it's worth our time with the war going on, but <SOA>if you want to clear out the [PLACE], I'll make sure you're repaid for your work.<EOA>"
"[PLACE] Estate is a bee farm; they raise the wretched little things for honey. It's owned by some smart-mouth wood elf named [CHARACTER]. We had an arrangement with [CHARACTER]. We kept an eye on [PLACE] Estate to make sure the honey kept flowing. In return, [CHARACTER] allowed us to extort [CHARACTER] and bring in a huge payout. [PLACE] Estate brought in a mountain of gold for the Guild. You could almost call it our sweetest deal. Then out of the clear blue, [CHARACTER] stops sending us our cut. [CHARACTER] was... well, angry to put it kindly. We need you to teach [CHARACTER] a lesson by burning down three of the estate's hives and clearing out the safe in the main house. The catch is that you can't burn the whole place to the ground. [CHARACTER] would be furious if you did. She also prefers that [CHARACTER] remains alive, but <SOA>if [CHARACTER] tries to stop you from getting the job done, kill [CHARACTER]<EOA>. The Guild has a lot riding on this. Don't make me look foolish by mucking it up."
"I've finally found you! I want to join the College of [PLACE]. But I need help with my wards. <SOA>Can you teach me?<EOA> So, first, you raise your ward and I'll throw a little spell at it. That way I can see the 'right' way to do things."
"You've proven reliable. There's a group of [ENEMY] in my hold that I... may have had a few discreet dealings with. The cut they were giving me was good at first, but now it's time to clean things up. <SOA>Go to [PLACE]<EOA> and <SOA>take care of them<EOA>. Teach them to stop paying me. Execute every last [ENEMY]. Spare no one."
"Are you a [ENEMY]? I don't like your kind. No honor. No loyalty. Unreliable. But I can't turn away a potential ally in these times. Let's see if you're better than a common [ITEM]. My scouts have tracked down one of the [ENEMY] leaders, hiding out in their blood-soaked camps at [PLACE]. <SOA>Deal with that [ENEMY] leader<EOA>."
"[ENEMY] are a common problem in the [PLACE]. The Empire always demanded I leave them be, but the Empire isn't here now. Go and slay one of the beasts. It should let them know that [PLACE] is not to be trifled with. I'm counting on you."
"This store would finally be on its feet if I hadn't lost my last shipment to [ENEMY] attacks. A specially-made [ITEM] statuette. You aren't for hire, are you? A [ITEM]? I'll pay you if you can recover that statuette from the [ENEMY] at [PLACE]. I'll have a sum of gold waiting for you when you return."
"<SOA>Go assassinate [CHARACTER]<EOA>. [CHARACTER]'s a hapless beggar living in some ruins just outside the village of [PLACE]. Easy even for you. You get to slaughter an emaciated beggar in cold blood. You are truly an opponent to be feared. I'll have your payment waiting for you."
"I have an assassination contract for you: [CHARACTER], a pirate captain. [CHARACTER] can be found aboard [CHARACTER]'s ship, the [PLACE] Wave. It's currently docked at the [PLACE] docks. [CHARACTER] is a ruthless she-devil, by all accounts. Deadly with a blade. And let's not forget [CHARACTER]'s crew - loyal and bloodthirsty, the lot of them. This is my final contract, and certainly the most challenging. Be careful with this one, my friend. If you are capable of pulling through this, you've not only earned your payment, but my respect as well. And believe me, friend - that does not come easily."
"I have another assassination contract for you: [CHARACTER]. [CHARACTER]'s dangerous. Very dangerous. A rogue Dark Elf mage doing research into dwarven artifacts should be both respected... and feared. Just not by you. [CHARACTER] is doing [CHARACTER]'s research in [PLACE]. A Dwarven ruin... what an exotic place for a kill. I hope the elf doesn't give you too much trouble. I once got set on fire by a sorcerer. Nasty business, that. But I digress."
"Your next assassination target is [CHARACTER]. [CHARACTER] is staying at [PLACE] Inn in [PLACE]. [CHARACTER] is, by all accounts, the worst bard in all of [PLACE]. No one would hold it against you if you flayed that horrible bard alive and made a drum from [CHARACTER]'s skin... Apparently so many people sought [CHARACTER]'s death, a lottery had to be arranged to determine the client. The only good bard is a dead one, as far as I'm concerned. All that singing and... mirth."
"[CHARACTER] is an accomplished wizard, and your assassination target. Locating [CHARACTER] may be challenging, as [CHARACTER] travels with the caravans. Those caravaners can be an elusive bunch. Takes a fair bit of stalking to take one down. But then, that's half the fun, isn't it?"
"You are going on a little vacation in [PLACE]. You'll be able to enjoy the sights, sample the food... and kill the housecarl, [CHARACTER]. You know what that means? [CHARACTER]'s the bodyguard to the Jarl of [PLACE] himself. So be careful. That's sure to throw a branch into [PLACE]'s well-oiled political machine."
"You are going to assassinate [CHARACTER]. [CHARACTER]'s a vampire, and has blended into human society for years. [CHARACTER]'s never far from [CHARACTER]'s female companion, [CHARACTER]. Also a vampire. The contract is for the male, [CHARACTER]. But you'll probably have to contend with the female, too. They both live in [PLACE]. So for Sithis' sake, watch yourself. <SOA>Face a vampire<EOA>, and live to tell the tale!"
"[CHARACTER] Papius lives just outside [PLACE]'s Mill, in the woods. [CHARACTER] was once the miller. Now [CHARACTER] is just a paranoid recluse who thinks someone is out to get [CHARACTER]. And [CHARACTER]'s right. Y<SOA>ou will assassinate [CHARACTER] and prove [CHARACTER]'s paranoia legitimate<EOA>."
"There's [CHARACTER], a Wood Elf, who owns a market stall in the city of [PLACE]. [CHARACTER] may run a stall in the city, but [CHARACTER] retreats to the plains outside [PLACE] to hunt. <SOA>Kill [CHARACTER] there<EOA>, and no one will bear witness... The hunter shall come to know the fear of the hunted, hmm? And I shall have your payment waiting for you, my friend."
"There's an assassination contract for you. <SOA>You are to kill [CHARACTER]<EOA>. [CHARACTER] is an Argonian layabout, likes to scavenge shipwrecks. My guess is [CHARACTER]'ll run if threatened. Or swim, if given the chance. Personally, I've always found Argonians to be incredibly unpredictable opponents. Especially near water. Unfortunately, [CHARACTER] is at [PLACE]'s Folly, a small waterlogged shipwreck northeast of [PLACE]. Making [CHARACTER] stay out of water will be difficult."
"The house specialty is the finest [ITEM] to cross your lips, friend. My own personal formula that I call [CHARACTER]'s [ITEM]. In fact, I've just added some new ingredients to the mixture that I think makes it taste better than ever. All I need to do is get the word out that it's ready and they'll flock here for it. Here, take these ten samples of the [ITEM] and spread the word. <SOA>If you get rid of all of them, there's something extra in it for you<EOA>."
"Someone has contracted us to kill [CHARACTER]. She separated from her husband several months ago. Now the two run competing mining operations in [PLACE]. I hear the mining business is extremely cutthroat. And those hours... they're murder. [CHARACTER]'s angry and desperate. A fighter."
"The [ENEMY] need dedicated men and women who're devoted to the cause and willing to die for it. Before I can put you to use, I need to know how much you can take. I have a little test for you. I'm sending you to [PLACE]. If you survive, you pass. If you die, well, you weren't going to be much use to me anyway. It's where men have tested their mettle for ages. There's a strange rock formation, built by the ancients. Something about that [PLACE] attracts the [ENEMY]s. <SOA>You kill an [ENEMY] out there<EOA>, and I'll have all the proof I need about you being [ENEMY] material."
"Last time I used the [ITEM] was at my dear friend [CHARACTER]'s house in [PLACE]... [PLACE] I believe it's called. The [ITEM] should still be in [PLACE] at the [PLACE]. I don't know why I didn't just take it with me. And last is the gem. I left that one in [PLACE] at the [PLACE]. It was a good trade too. Ah well. <SOA>Bring those items back to me<EOA> and I'll be happy to experiment on you. No, no... that isn't right. I'd be happy to reward you."
"You are now ready for your last trial. Retrieve the Horn of [CHARACTER], our founder, from his tomb in the ancient fane of [PLACE]. Remain true to the Way of the Voice, and you will return. Then it is time for us to recognize you formally as [CHARACTER]."
"We've gotten a letter about [CHARACTER] needing some muscle up in [PLACE]. I don't know what the fight is about, and that's not our business anyway. I just need you to go out there, look tough, and scare this milk drinker [CHARACTER] into submission. No more than that. I don't want to hear about a killing, understand? <SOA>Go. Bring honor to yourself<EOA>, and the [CHARACTER]."
"I know what you want. Word travels fast around here. Discovered some big mystery, huh? Well, you don't even need to ask. No, I don't have anything for you. Not anymore, anyway. [CHARACTER] stole a [NUMBER] of books when he ran off to [PLACE] to join those [ENEMY]. Some kind of peace offering. I think one of those volumes may have had some relevant information. <SOA>If you want them, you'll have to talk to [CHARACTER]<EOA>."
"To tell you the truth, I've been a little distracted. I've got this... idea. I want to ring the whole hall with [ENEMY]'s little spears. Mocking us, from the past. Making us work harder. Fight better. The only problem is, I'm going to need a lot of spears. A lot. So, if you could <SOA>find a bunch of them for me<EOA>, that would make it easier on me."
"My mind weighs heavy enough. [CHARACTER]'s so lost in [CHARACTER]'s visions, and it's only getting worse. I've looked after [CHARACTER]'s safety for so long... If [CHARACTER] can't tell what's real and what's not, how will [CHARACTER] continue to lead [PLACE]? There is a letter, one I have had for some time now. I think it is time it gets delivered. I cannot leave [CHARACTER]'s side, so I must stay here. <SOA>Could you see that it reaches Captain [CHARACTER] in [PLACE]?<EOA> Please, do not open it. It is... private."
"Halt, outlander. By the Code of [CHARACTER], this stronghold belongs to the Orcs. Your kind are unwelcome. You're not an Orc, or Blood-Kin, so stay out. We only help our own. Hmm... there is a way to become Blood-Kin, if you truly insist on entering our stronghold. We've heard whispers of an enchanted pair of gauntlets, hidden and protected by dangerous [ENEMY], beasts, or worse. They are called the Forgemaster's Fingers. Find them at Stony Creek Cave. <SOA>Bring them to our chief<EOA>, and he will decide if you're worthy to be Blood-Kin to the Orcs."
"I am [CHARACTER], the Gardener of Men, knower of the unknown, master of fates. You stand in my [PLACE], mortal. You have sought out the forbidden knowledge that only one other has obtained. You are a seeker of knowledge and power, like [CHARACTER] before you. The [ENEMY] have withheld their secrets from me for many long years. The time has come for this knowledge to be added to my library. Convince them to give up their secrets. My word is as true as fate, as inevitable as destiny. <SOA>Bring me what I want<EOA>, and I will give you what you seek."
"You don't remember me, [CHARACTER]? Two campaigns we served together. You saved my life time and time again. You promised me, [CHARACTER]. You promised that when we sacked [PLACE], you would make me your sworn brother. And I've waited. Even after the [ENEMY]' arrows dug into my chest and their hammers crushed my bones. I've waited. <SOA>Give me your sword, [CHARACTER]<EOA>. That we may become brothers as you promised."
"<SOA>You've got to help me!<EOA> I conjured an [ENEMY] Guardian and now it's running amok in [PLACE]. Master [CHARACTER] refused to teach me the [ENEMY] Guardian spell. So I read his spell book on my own and learned it. Something went wrong when I cast it. The creature is attacking everything in sight. I need to keep Master [CHARACTER] distracted so he doesn't find out what I did. There is no telling what he would do to me. While you are taking care of the creature, I'll try to figure out what went wrong. I don't have any gold to pay you with, but I can give you this [ITEM]."
"We did have a bit of a... break-in. But we still have plenty to sell. Robbers were only after one thing. An [ITEM], solid gold. In the shape of a [ENEMY]'s claw. I've got some coin coming in from my last shipment. It's yours if you bring my claw back. If you're going after those thieves, you should head to Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of [PLACE]."
"[CHARACTER]'s blade, [ITEM], was lost years ago in a [PLACE]. Without it, I feel almost as defenseless as a newborn. I don't think I'll ever be able to find a replacement. I was adventuring in the depths of the [PLACE] when I was attacked by a massive [ENEMY]... like nothing I had ever seen. When the colossus struck, [ITEM] was knocked from my grasp and I was wounded badly. It was only through blind luck that I was able to crawl away from the [ENEMY] abomination and make my way to the surface. I couldn't ask you to undertake such a treacherous journey, it would be a fool's errand. But I see that spark in your eye and I know better than to warn you away. [ITEM] rests with the [PLACE] of [CHARACTER]. Tread carefully, friend... those same [PLACE] almost took my life."
"There are all sorts of people wandering around carryin' their valuables on their person... just waitin' for someone like you to pick their pocket. So, you in for a little fishin'? One of our marks seems to have an [ITEM] of value we want to add to our vault. Get it for us and you'll receive the usual pay. Sound good?"
"If you're feeling adventurous, I'm always looking for someone to procure valuable books from some more... dangerous [PLACE]s. Here, I scribbled down the last [PLACE] I'd heard about. <SOA>Check it out<EOA>, but be careful."
"[PLACE] is known for its graveyard, traveler. We've buried more dead than you can imagine. I just finished giving my old war companion, [CHARACTER], a proper burial by fire. Old hard head hated the idea of being lost cold in the ground.<SOA>Could you deliver the ashes to [CHARACTER], the priest of [ITEM]?<EOA> He'll know the right blessings to make for [CHARACTER]'s soul."
"If you're one of the [CHARACTER]'s men, you'll get your [ITEM]. [PLACE]'s Mill pays its debts. Sorry, I thought [CHARACTER] the Elder sent you. We've got an order to fill, and he's not known for patience. Look, if you're heading towards [PLACE] anytime soon, <SOA>can you give the [CHARACTER] this note?<EOA> Let him know he'll get his [ITEM]."
"Everything you see is grown at my family's own [PLACE] Farm. Fresh and filling. I also do a little herb growing. The court wizard, [CHARACTER], pays us to plant a little [ITEM]. Who knows what [CHARACTER] uses it for? A poison like that? Hey, <SOA>could you deliver this bottle of [ITEM] extract to [CHARACTER]?"<EOA>
"[CHARACTER] is a vampire. My family is entrusted with keeping him buried, but recently someone stole the wardstone that sealed him in the grave, and [CHARACTER] escaped. It's too late for the wardstone. [CHARACTER] must be destroyed. If this gets out, my family will suffer great shame. See that [CHARACTER] is destroyed. [CHARACTER] will have fled to gather others of his kind at [PLACE] Throne."
"You are exactly what I was looking for. You see, my name is [CHARACTER]. And I have a problem I think you can help sort out. My master and I had a bit of a falling out. We got into an argument and it got rather... heated. He's kicked me out until I find someone who can settle our disagreement. That's where you come in. My master is [CHARACTER], the prince of wishes. As you can imagine, he's quite the important person. Now, since he banished me, [CHARACTER]'s been rather weak. [CHARACTER] can't manifest very far from one of [CHARACTER]'s shrines. I know there's a cult that worships [CHARACTER] at [PLACE]. We should be able to talk to [CHARACTER] there. If this works out, I'll make sure you're rewarded. Just don't trust any offer [CHARACTER] makes you... okay?"
"Get over to [PLACE]. Rumor has it the Jarl's Steward, [CHARACTER], is a faithful [ITEM] worshiper, if not a true son of [PLACE] - [CHARACTER] still supports the Empire, after all. But, if confronted with proof of [CHARACTER]'s belief, you might be able to 'persuade' [CHARACTER] to aid our cause, indirectly of course. Wouldn't want to sully [CHARACTER]'s reputation, would we? You'll need to be careful with this one. The Jarl's men won't look kindly on you rummaging through [CHARACTER]'s quarters."
"Passing through on your way to [PLACE]? About to make a delivery up there myself. I mostly deliver [ITEM] supplies like dried fish and salted meats; you know, things that keep fresh for a long time. The [CHARACTER] tend not to get out much, if you catch my meaning. It's kind of an understanding between us. I mean, it just wouldn't feel right to charge them for a bit of preserved [ITEM]. Trouble is, my legs aren't what they used to be and climbing the [NUMBER] Steps takes its toll. You'd like to make the delivery for me? Really? That would be kind of you. Here, take this bag of [ITEM]. At the top of the steps, you'll see the offering chest. <SOA>Just leave the bag inside<EOA> and you're done."
"The [PLACE] are where we inter our dead. They are sacred places, meant to honor their passing. Sadly, we've been unable to use the [PLACE] beneath the [PLACE] as of late, and have resorted to other locations to scatter the remains. Those foul vermin... the abominations we call [ENEMY] have risen from the ashes of our own ancestors. They're befouling the memories of our forefathers by defiling their remains. Could you cleanse the [PLACE] for us, wanderer? That would be most kind. Here, this key should open the door to the [PLACE]."
"I've got a bit of an errand to perform, but I need an extra pair of hands. And in my line of work, extra hands are well-paid. It's simple... I'm going to cause a distraction, and you're going to steal [CHARACTER]'s silver ring from a strongbox under [CHARACTER]'s stand. Once you have it, I want you to place it in [CHARACTER]'s pocket without [CHARACTER] noticing. There's someone that wants to see [CHARACTER] put out of business permanently. That's all you need to know. Now, you tell me when you're ready and we'll get started."
"I hate [CHARACTER]! It's everything about [CHARACTER]. [CHARACTER] is disgusting. I think [CHARACTER] takes [CHARACTER]'s worship of [CHARACTER] a bit too seriously. Do you know [CHARACTER] has slept with [NUMBER] different [ENEMY] in the last [NUMBER] alone? What kind of a [CHARACTER] would do such a thing? Just for once, I'd like to see [CHARACTER] squirm... to rub [CHARACTER]'s nose in it. Actually, there is a way to do this, but I don't think I could get away with doing it. [CHARACTER]'d kill me if [CHARACTER] found out. You see, I happen to know after [CHARACTER] makes love, [CHARACTER] gives [CHARACTER]'s partner a token of [CHARACTER]'s affection called a [ITEM] of [CHARACTER]. If you confront [CHARACTER] with [NUMBER] of the [ITEM] of [CHARACTER], [CHARACTER]'d be so embarrassed... well, I don't know what [CHARACTER]'d do! Oh, this is going to be great! <SOA>You need to get the [ITEM] of [CHARACTER] from [CHARACTER], [CHARACTER], and [CHARACTER]<EOA>. Not sure how you're going to do that, but try your best. Then just confront [CHARACTER] with them, and the rest works itself out."
"I have a little job for you. Pretty simple. <SOA>Break into a house<EOA>, <SOA>grab a specific [ITEM]<EOA>, and <SOA>get out before they realize what's going on<EOA>. The catch is you can't kill anyone who lives there or you forfeit the payment. You ready for some good old-fashioned burglary?"
"I'm having trouble. [CHARACTER] bullies me all the time. All the elders think I'm a milk drinker 'cause I can't fight. Nobody understands. <SOA>If you can get [CHARACTER] to leave me alone, I'll be your best friend... forever!<EOA> I'll pay you, too! My whole life's savings - two [ITEM]!"
"I've been having difficulties with my heart stone experiments. Have you heard of the [CHARACTER]? They are fierce warriors of the [ENEMY] tribes. They actually remove their own hearts, and replace them with large [ITEM] seeds. It puts their lifesparks in direct connection to the natural forces. Well, I'm hoping to do something similar... if I could connect a living being to the forces of nature... well... that would be formidable. I've done some experiments in this area, but, well, my test subjects are far too fragile. I'm hoping to learn some of the [CHARACTER] techniques, their methods. I need you to examine one of them. <SOA>Just investigate as much as you can<EOA>. The [ENEMY] live in the hills on the western edge of [PLACE]. From there, you're on your own. I'm given to understand that they are not difficult to find, if you gather my inference."
"The [ENEMY] Malkoran defiles my shrine with vile corruptions, trapping lost souls left in the wake of this war to do his bidding. Worse still, he uses the power stored within my own token to fuel his foul deeds. Mortals call my token [ITEM], for it was forged in a holy light that breaks upon my foes, burning away corruption and false life. You will enter my shrine, destroy Malkoran, and retrieve this mighty [ITEM]. I have brought you here, mortal, to be my champion. <SOA>You will do this. I have commanded it!<EOA>"
"A few days ago, some [ENEMY] from [PLACE] broke in here and stole it! Can you imagine? Took the only thing of value we had. It was a family heirloom. I can't even put a price on how much that thing means to me. I'm sure that they are from [PLACE]. I bumped into them when I was coming back to my farm after buying supplies. I know those lowlifes took it with them back to the [PLACE]. They left an unmistakable stench behind. If you have the guts to <SOA>head into the [PLACE]<EOA> and <SOA>get my [ITEM] back<EOA>, I'll pay you what I can. It would be nice to have it back... means a lot to me."
"[CHARACTER] is the Goddess of Love. The temple spreads her gifts by tending to the sick, the poor, and the lost. We also perform wedding ceremonies for all the loving couples. You wish to be married to your future spouse? It's good to see love blossoming, even during these difficult times. Your wedding will be held tomorrow, from dawn until dusk, in the Temple of [CHARACTER]."
"Who enters? Will nobody save poor [CHARACTER]? You, meat! Come, come. Don't leave poor [CHARACTER] to die. Pretty, pretty flesh. Let me out! [CHARACTER]! Evil [CHARACTER] put me in a cage, stole my tower. Hate [CHARACTER], chew [CHARACTER]'s bones! Let me out, kind, kind meat. Ah, I have a pretty [ITEM]. <SOA>Help me find [CHARACTER]<EOA>, wring [CHARACTER]'s neck, pluck [CHARACTER]'s eyes. Take my prize [ITEM], I just want my tower back!"
"I'm [CHARACTER] of the [ENEMY]. We are vampire hunters. We search out and destroy those bloodsucking scum wherever we find them. We are looking for anyone willing to fight against the growing vampire menace. Everybody says that they are not interested about joining, right up until they find their throat being ripped out by a pack of hungry vampires. Want to sign up to the [ENEMY] and <SOA>kill vampires?<EOA> <SOA>Go talk to [CHARACTER], our leader, at [PLACE], southeast of [PLACE]<EOA>. [CHARACTER]'ll decide if you're [ENEMY] material."
"The [ENEMY] will, no doubt, soon become even more of a nuisance now that [CHARACTER]'s Bow has been recovered. We need to strike a crippling blow against them before they muster more [NUMBER] against us. They've holed up in an abandoned [PLACE] in the Reach. The [ENEMY] are apparently focused on exterminating vampires, noble and brute alike. Not a serious threat, but we can't leave them completely unchecked or they may become one. But their time has come to an end. And you will be the one that ends it. Killing their leaders should discourage them from an out and out war with us."
"There's something... personal... I was hoping you would do for me. As you may know [CHARACTER] worship is outlawed in the Empire. When we buried my husband I made offerings to all the gods... except [CHARACTER]. My husband [CHARACTER] would want a proper burial. <SOA>I would like you to take an [ITEM] of his<EOA>, a war horn handed down from his father, and <SOA>place it at a Shrine of [CHARACTER]<EOA>. It would mean a lot to me."
"Ah, a student of the craft. You'll need to start by learning an enchantment. Take an enchanted [ITEM] or piece of [ITEM], then use the Arcane Enchanter to learn its secrets. The [ITEM] is destroyed in the process, so be wary. Once you know an enchantment, you'll need a filled soul gem, and something to enchant. You'll use the Arcane Enchanter for that, too. Of course I have everything you need for sale, if you have the coin."
"I was the finest scout in the [ITEM] Legion, once. Tracked down all the places in the wilds that were causing people trouble. Lost my [ITEM] in one of the old caves. My pretty, pretty [ITEM]. Life just got worse after that. Kept losing things. So many things.... <SOA>Oh, could you find that [ITEM] for me?<EOA> I sure would love to have it again. Could show you some of my old scouting tricks."
"I am [CHARACTER], a priest of [CHARACTER]. I came into [CHARACTER]'s light after the Great War. So many died by my hands, my magics. I'm fortunate that [CHARACTER] and the people of [PLACE] have come to accept me as one of their own. <SOA>Could you do an old elf a favor?<EOA> I misplaced my journal in a cave I was exploring. I'll pay for its return. Blessing of [CHARACTER] to you for your help."
"I was a mage back in [PLACE]. I lend my talents to the mines here, helping them keep the tunnels safe. By [ITEM], it gets hot in there. I use [ITEM] Salts for a [ITEM] to keep the heat bearable, but I'm out. <SOA>If you want to go to the trouble of getting me some [ITEM], feel free<EOA>. I suppose I could offer you a bit of free [ITEM] training when you get back."
"I do have more work for you. A personal matter. My father died trying to negotiate with the [ENEMY], back when that was possible. They took his shield to [PLACE]'s End, to those [ENEMY] they consort with. I need you to bring it home where it belongs. I warn you, it's dangerous work. No man of mine has ever faced a [ENEMY] and lived. I'll understand if you decline. <SOA>Return my father's shield<EOA> to me and I'll grant you permission to purchase property in my [PLACE]. Divines watch over you."
"The [ENEMY] hunted us down. It wasn't exactly great for recruitment. But we have a headquarters of a sort now. We'll rebuild the [ENEMY]. If you find anyone you think would make a good recruit, I can certainly take a look at them. Remember, though, being a [ENEMY] is a lifelong commitment. Their loyalty has to be with us once they're in. After you have recruited enough new [ENEMY], <SOA>ask [CHARACTER] about the dragon lairs [CHARACTER]'s been studying<EOA>. We'll have the recruits do some dragon hunting with you."
"Where is that ash sucking steward of mine? [CHARACTER]! Have you seen [CHARACTER]? I'm hungry. Find [CHARACTER]. Tell [CHARACTER] I want apple cabbage stew, with some canis root tea. After all, I don't make my own tea. I am a master wizard of the [PLACE] Telvanni. Other people make tea for me. You are not my servant? Obviously not, or you would have a cup of tea in your hands. I supposed you want to be asked nicely. Very well. Please, oh hero of [PLACE]. <SOA>Please find [CHARACTER]<EOA>. I shall be ever so grateful."
"Most of the establishments in [PLACE] keep their transactions recorded within business ledgers. <SOA>Your job would be to change the [NUMBER] in those books so the shortfalls from our other jobs look legit<EOA>. In this case, we want to waylay a shipment on the way from this [PLACE] without [PLACE] even noticin' anything went missin'. <SOA>Feel like doing a bit of writin' in [PLACE] in [PLACE]<EOA>?"
"Of course I am the [PLACE] blacksmith. What do I look like, a tavern wench? Ah, don't let my words cut you too deep. I've just been working the forge too hard. Trying to set this [ITEM] right. [CHARACTER] wants it to look like an ancient blade. High Queen Freydis ruled over [PLACE] in the Second Era, and her [ITEM] was legendary. Getting the real [ITEM] would be even better than making a copy, but no one wants to risk getting it from its resting place, [PLACE]. <SOA>If you find that [ITEM], traveler, I'd be grateful<EOA>."
"I'm [CHARACTER], the husband of [CHARACTER]. My [CHARACTER] doesn't like that I've been spending so much time looking for my father's old [ITEM]. He fed his entire family with the gold he made using that [ITEM]. I'm not about to let it gather dust in some [ENEMY]'s trophy room. I tracked it to a group of [ENEMY] nearby. The place is called [PLACE]. But I'm no fool. I'd need the [PLACE] guards or maybe hire some mercenaries to get it. I don't know why I'm saying this, but <SOA>if you find it out in your travels, I'd be grateful to you<EOA>."
"I began praying to [ENEMY], the god of wealth, to bring us some fortune, but [ENEMY] made off with my sacred [ITEM] almost as soon as I bought it. <SOA>If you found my [ITEM], [CHARACTER] would be in your debt<EOA>, kind one."
"I'm [CHARACTER] Letrush. Looking for work? I need someone to deliver a message to [CHARACTER] Black-Briar. I recently approached [CHARACTER] Black-Briar about buying [ITEM], one of the finest breeding horses in the realm. He agreed to sell. I paid [CHARACTER] half the cost of [ITEM] up front, but before he could deliver, [CHARACTER] had him locked up. [CHARACTER] believes this exempts him from our deal. It does not. Head to the [PLACE] Jail and talk to [CHARACTER]. <SOA>Get him to tell you where [ITEM] and his [ITEM]<EOA> are and <SOA>bring them to me outside [PLACE]<EOA>. You'll be well paid for your time."
"I'm sorry to drag you into [PLACE]'s problems, but after that attack in the market, I'm running out of time. You want answers? Well so do I. So does everyone in this [PLACE]. A man goes crazy in the market. Everyone knows he's a [ENEMY] agent. Guards do nothing. Nothing but clean up the mess. This has been going on for years. And all I've been able to find is murder and blood. <SOA>I need help. Please.<EOA> <SOA>You find out why that woman [CHARACTER] was attacked, who's behind the [ENEMY]<EOA>, and I'll pay you for any information you bring me."
"We're aware of a [ITEM] dealer's presence in the warehouse within this [PLACE]. Unfortunately, we're certain this [ITEM] dealer, [CHARACTER], has informants within the [PLACE] guard. Every time we've made a move to arrest him, he's escaped. However, if you'd take care of this discreetly, you might be able to surprise him without warning. Here, this is the key to the warehouse. <SOA>See if you can drop in on this dealer of poison<EOA> and <SOA>convince him to close down his operation permanently<EOA>."
"<SOA>You're going to go kill a [ENEMY] spy<EOA>. But don't draw attention. Some kills are for fun, some for profit. And others are for sending messages. This one is a message. Don't make a big scene. Don't get caught. The corpse is to be the message, not the attack. With any luck he'll bleed to death before anyone notices. A cold corpse will say what we want better than a warm one."
"Things are getting a bit thin. Get that [CHARACTER] in [PLACE], and do it quickly. I'm not sure how much [TIME] I have left. It's essential. Simply essential! If only it were essentially simple... but it's not. I want him there guarding those [PLACE]s. If any of [ENEMY]'s forces show up, he should be ready for them. It wouldn't do to just let them in if more show up. And more always show up. Still and all, I think things are going well, considering! <SOA>Go talk to [CHARACTER] in [PLACE]<EOA>. Tell her you're working for me. She'd do anything for me, that little minx."
"Faded Note The last thoughts of one of [PLACE]'s residents I don't think I'll live much longer. My [ITEM] supply is thinning, only one bottle left. [CHARACTER]'s [ITEM] is worthless! I would have lasted longer on bark. I'd go back home to resupply, but [CHARACTER], that maggot, has stolen my house. It's not just him, though, it's also the others. I can't leave the safety of the roof. They have a plan for me, I see it in their eyes. <SOA>[CHARACTER], [CHARACTER], [CHARACTER], ALL OF THEM!<EOA> They don't know I'm up here, watching. Not much longer, though. At least they won't find me or my [ITEM]. I've put all my favorite things in an urn, and sunken it in the sewage near the back of [CHARACTER]'s dive. I think I'll drink that last bottle to celebrate."
"Once I am gone, things usually get bad quickly. You'll need the respect of My citizens. They'll need a leader, someone to look up to when I'm gone. They're the backbone of any great land. Except where the backbone is an actual backbone. Ever been to [PLACE]'s realm...? Nasty stuff. But, back to the business at hand. You'll need to control one of the Courts of Madness. Replace a current [CHARACTER]. Or [CHARACTER]. Whichever. That will command respect! The people will rally around you. You'll have their love, their admiration, their complaints! Whatever. As long as it keeps them on Our side. <SOA>Speak to [CHARACTER] and [CHARACTER], the High Priests at the [PLACE]<EOA>. They can explain what needs to be done."
"Oh... hello. Sickly [CHARACTER], proprietor. Don't get too close now. You might catch what I have. Well... it seems I am dying. Yes, these may be my last days in the [PLACE]. That is, unless someone like yourself could help me find the cure. But no one has taken me up on my offer, even with the promise of a reward. Ah well, it's been a good life I suppose.... There's only one [PLACE] in all the [PLACE] to get the cure for what I have... Knotty Bramble. I'll mark it on your map. There, on the lowest level of the [PLACE], is a pool containing the cure: [ITEM]. Legend has it that it bubbles up from around an old statue. <SOA>Bring me back the remedy<EOA>, and I will reward you well with a [ITEM] of Verdure. Here, take this special flask to collect the [ITEM]."
"There's a perfect job for you, my newest and only Noble in the realm! A messenger told me that [ENEMY] has attacked my army's stronghold at [PLACE] and routed my soldiers! If [ENEMY] has truly entered my army's stronghold, things have taken a disturbing turn. It means [ENEMY] has tried subterfuge... not its strong suit. Amazing! Perhaps things aren't going as poorly as I'd imagined. You'll want to get all the details from the messenger. Unless you already have. You haven't, have you?
"We're up against powerful [ENEMY]s, unlike anything we've seen before. And they have an Elder Scroll. There are [CHARACTER] I've met and worked with over the years. We need their skills, their talents, if we're going to survive this. I think we'll want [CHARACTER]. [ITEM] girl, whip-smart and good with tinkering. Fascination with the Dwemer. [ITEM]s in particular. Last I knew, [CHARACTER] was out in the [PLACE], convinced [CHARACTER] was about to find the biggest dwarven ruins yet. You'll also want to find [CHARACTER]. Big brute of a [PLACE], hates [ENEMY]s almost as much as I do. Got it into [CHARACTER] head years back that [CHARACTER] experience with animals would help. [ENEMY]s in particular, from what I hear. <SOA>If you can find them, we might have a chance<EOA>."
"I am [CHARACTER]. Some call me Saint [CHARACTER]. Others call me [CHARACTER] the Eradicator. Perhaps you've heard of me? If you haven't, I can't say that I am surprised. Until I get my second volume published, no one will ever know of my achievements. In order to write the second volume of my opus, I need the notes from my first volume. Otherwise, I need to do all of this from memory. When I was tossed in here, I felt myself falling… and I dropped the pages I had been holding. There were [NUMBER] of them in all. <SOA>Find them for me, please, I beg you!<EOA>"
"I've learned of a possible [ENEMY]. And while I do not know its exact whereabouts, I do have information suggesting someone who does. Pay a visit to the [ENEMY]'s last known contact. Do what you must to find where it's hiding now. <SOA>Then root out the [ENEMY], and destroy it<EOA>."
"The day hasn't been won while the [ENEMY] still walks [PLACE]. Let me address the [ENEMY] Guard, and then we'll be off. The [CHARACTER] deserve to know that we've finally gained the upper hand. It's time we take the fight to their door. Gather your things and rest well, my friend. We meet outside [PLACE]."
"I think we both know... it's time to face my father [CHARACTER]. If we don't, [CHARACTER]'ll keep chasing us for the rest of our lives. Well, before we spoke to my mother in the [PLACE] [PLACE], I would have said we bring the bow to my father. But after everything with [CHARACTER]... I don't think we can trust [CHARACTER]. No. <SOA>[CHARACTER] has to die<EOA>. We have no choice. <SOA>Let's face [CHARACTER] together<EOA>."
"I've learned the whereabouts of a troublesome [ENEMY] member. You will track him down and dispose of him. But please, do be discreet. Don't. Get. Caught. Our aim isn't to stir the nest, just to skin a rat, reminding them that they are the prey."
"I've located the whereabouts of a [ENEMY] masquerading as a common citizen in [PLACE]. Track him down and dispose of him. [ENEMY]s enjoy stalking their prey. Passing among us undetected emboldens them. Makes them feel powerful, untouchable. But we'll put a swift end to that. Tread lightly. The [ENEMY] can cloud the minds of those he preys upon. It won't be easy to convince anyone he's other than he appears. The law is unaware of the danger and will treat you as a criminal if you are caught. You must be clever. <SOA>Find a way not to be caught or accused of murder<EOA>. We must be vigilant and self-sufficient if we are to defeat these [ENEMY]s."
"[NUMBER] years of research down the drain! I've been studying the [ITEM]. Yes, the aquamarine colored crystals usually native to Ayleid ruins. It seems I'm the first to discover them growing in a natural cave. That's about all I can say about it. I don't suppose I could convince you to help me recover my research notes? I was doing some research in [PLACE], and suddenly I was attacked. I grabbed everything I could and ran, but I fear I dropped my notes. Those notes are very important to me and represent [NUMBER] years of my life. <SOA>If you could recover them, I'd be sure to reward you appropriately with some potent [ITEM]<EOA>."
"The kingdom is in dire need of a skilled hunter to take down a ferocious dragon that has been terrorizing our villages. The beast has been spotted flying over the mountains to the east. <SOA>Will you answer the call to defend our people?<EOA>"
"Oh, thank the gods you're here! Our village is plagued by a terrible curse that causes our crops to wither and die. We believe the source of the curse lies within a long-abandoned temple deep in the jungle. <SOA>Can you find a way to lift the curse and restore our livelihoods?<EOA>"
"We've received reports of a group of bandits who have taken over an old fortification northwest of here. They've been raiding nearby towns and terrorizing innocent civilians. <SOA>We need someone brave enough to put an end to their evil deeds once and for all<EOA>."
"Ah, a brave adventurer such as yourself deserves a challenge worthy of your skills. In the heart of the swampy wetlands lies a mysterious tower said to contain ancient treasures and knowledge. However, its levels are filled with dangerous creatures and obstacles. <SOA>Are you ready to uncover its secrets?<EOA>"
"A notorious outlaw gang is causing chaos in the region. <SOA>Track down and capture or eliminate the gang members<EOA>. Bring proof of their demise for a hefty bounty reward."

"A group of bandits is causing trouble in the desert. <SOA>Track them to their hideout, eliminate the threat, and bring peace to our nomadic community<EOA>. A bounty awaits the successful bounty hunter."
"A curse has befallen ancient ruins, attracting dangerous creatures. <SOA>Clear the area, break the curse, and restore safety to the region<EOA>. The mystic council offers a bounty for your efforts."

"My [CHARACTER] [CHARACTER] said he was going east towards the border of [PLACE] to trade some of our grain to some folks at [PLACE]. I waited and waited, and he never came back. Probably shacked up with some elven whore. Good riddance to him I say. If I only knew where he was, I'd sure give him a piece of my mind. <SOA>If you see him, tell him<EOA> [CHARACTER] said he can go straight to hell... he's not welcome here any more."
"[CHARACTER]'s notes on how to summarize a lifetime of research? So little of what I have learned matters now - the petty politics of ancient times, the age-long campaign to wipe out all mention of the [ENEMY] name. In the opening days of the [NUMBER] Era, the Archmage [ENEMY] was revered throughout the north. Wisdom, wealth, honor, and power were his, and even the legendary heros' heirs sought his counsel. Smothered by his shadow, [ENEMY]'s three sons grew cruel and resentful. They lusted after their father's power and prestige, and eventually [ENEMY], the eldest, discovered its source: a mysterious [ITEM], from which he never parted. Together, they conspired to murder their father in his sleep and divide his [ITEM] between them. And so it was done. Consumed by their newfound power, the brothers laid waste to the surrounding villages. So great was the carnage that the High King himself intervened, sending a company of battlemages led by the Archmage [CHARACTER] to subdue the brothers. And after a devastating battle, the three fled the field. [ENEMY], the youngest, was run to ground in [PLACE], the ancient barrows at the foot of [PLACE]. [CHARACTER] pursued [ENEMY] to the shattered crypts of [PLACE], half-buried even then. And at last, [ENEMY] was cornered in the southernmost reaches of [PLACE] and later entombed in [PLACE]."
"<SOA>You're really going to the [PLACE]?<EOA> That presents an opportunity. If you were willing to wear one of [ITEM]'s outfits and speak to the Jarl I would not only pay you but let you keep the [ITEM]. Here's the [ITEM]. <SOA>Try to get Jarl [CHARACTER]'s opinion<EOA> on it and if she likes it mention it's from [ITEM]."
"Hmm? Oh, sorry. My mind wanders sometimes. I was just thinking about [CHARACTER]'s Lute. Over a year ago, thieves broke into the [PLACE] and made off with a lot of valuable things. Mostly gold and silver. But they also stole [CHARACTER]'s Lute. We just learned where the [ENEMY] fled to, and I very much want that lute back. They are at [PLACE]. [CHARACTER] was the bard who invented the eight course lute that is commonplace today. Until he found a way to string the extra courses, bards only had six course lutes. The lute they stole is [CHARACTER]'s original eight course lute. I doubt they even realize its true value. There is no way I can pay you what this Lute is worth. But I can teach you a few tricks I've learned over the years."
"I'm aspiring to earn the title of an alchemist. However, the road ahead is paved with loose cobbles and deadly pitfalls. Master [CHARACTER] says I'm a natural; that I have a unique talent. But I fear his approval masks his intolerance for my mistakes. My errant formulas have cost Master [CHARACTER] a fortune in ingredients; some of which are almost irreplaceable. To restore Master [CHARACTER]'s supply <SOA>I would need [NUMBER] [ITEM], [NUMBER] [ITEM], and [NUMBER] [ITEM]<EOA>. Am I sensing that you may be interested in gathering these rare ingredients for me? That means more time for my experiments and less time in the field. Much appreciated."
"Doesn't everyone pity the hopeless? Look at me... I'm no better than a beggar. I used to be a miner, a good one too. I made more gold digging up ore in a month than some people earn in a lifetime. When the mine dried up, I was lost. I have no other trade, so I spend my time drinking my fortune away at the [PLACE]... or I used to anyway. That fetcher [CHARACTER] won't even allow me inside. Said I was bad for business. If I want to spend my last bag of coins getting drunk, that's my business. What does he care? <SOA>If you can get that stubborn mule to let me into the [PLACE]<EOA>, I'll make sure you get what's coming to you."
"I'm proud to say that I grow or harvest most of my exotic ingredients myself. I only wish I had a better source for [ENEMY]. Those creatures are difficult to track down since it's so dangerous beyond [PLACE]. <SOA>Could you gather some [ENEMY] for me? That would be splendid! [NUMBER] samples should be enough<EOA>. I'd be more than happy to give you something for the effort."
"[CHARACTER] is a damn tyrant. Always being goaded on by the [ENEMY] to get more work out of us. They pay us next to nothing. We get beaten if we make a mistake, and where are our kind [ENEMY] rulers? What are they doing? Typical. You would stick up for us. <SOA>You're going to try to talk sense into that [CHARACTER]?<EOA> I'll believe it when I see it. It's a week's wages for me, but you've earned every coin if you talk some sense into [CHARACTER]."
"[CHARACTER] has been in [PLACE] forever. Great storyteller. Keeps everyone's spirits up. Owes me a lot of coin for drinks. I keep telling him not to worry about it, but he's got the stubborn Nord blood. Damn fool doesn't have the coin to pay me back, so he just beats himself up over it, and then he gets thirsty, and it cycles all over again. <SOA>If you could convince him that I don't care about his tab<EOA>, it'd certainly make me feel better. [CHARACTER] pawned a few of [ITEM] back when he still had things to pawn. Take them as your reward."
"[CHARACTER] owes this [PLACE] enough coin to burn it down, build it back up, then burn it down again just for laughs. [CHARACTER]'s had some troubles in [CHARACTER]'s life, but I can't have [CHARACTER] drinking here without at least paying back some of the coin [CHARACTER] owes. <SOA>Go right ahead and talk to [CHARACTER]<EOA>. [CHARACTER] just might be sober enough to listen to you."
"If you're feeling adventurous, I'm always looking for someone to procure valuable [ITEM] from some more... dangerous [PLACE]s. Here, I scribbled down the last [PLACE] I'd heard about. <SOA>Check it out, but be careful<EOA>."
"Our time here is running out. The few of us left free of control cannot protect ourselves for much longer. You must go to [PLACE]. Learn there the Word of Power that [CHARACTER] learned long ago, and use that knowledge on the Wind Stone. <SOA>You may be able to break the hold on our people there, and free them from control<EOA>."
"Travelers have been coming to [PLACE]. They tell stories about [ENEMY]. I've heard of them, but didn't think they were real. Rumors also claim that you have defeated [ENEMY] before. You are a very brave person worthy of being a [ITEM]. But I already knew that. <SOA>Let's go kill [ENEMY] together<EOA>. That's one way to find out if they're real. I even know where we might find one. Lead on!"
"The Blades of the old hunted down many dragons in their day, and they have records of where the [ENEMY] lived. <SOA>Only you can truly defeat these [ENEMY]<EOA>, but you do not have to do so alone. The Blades can help you. Just ask whenever you're ready to take on [ENEMY]. We will send the Blades to help you fulfill your destiny. The [ENEMY]'s soul should make you stronger."
"I may be [CHARACTER] by birth, but I was raised [CHARACTER]. Through reasons I'm still trying to discover, I ended up orphaned then taken in by a kindly [CHARACTER] family in [PLACE]. I hope one day to find out what happened to me... how I ended up like that. I know when I was found by my [CHARACTER] father, I was wrapped in a blanket bearing the symbol of [PLACE]. It was one of the great houses in [PLACE] long ago. Whether that means I was one of them or not, I'm uncertain. <SOA>If you come across anything in your travels that might provide me with the answers I'm looking for<EOA>, I'd be grateful."
"My family came here centuries ago. We've made a good living smithing the silver that flows through [PLACE]. But you probably wanted to know about the fancy carvings and stonework, didn't you? Travelers always do. Here, I have a delivery I need to make to [CHARACTER] in [PLACE]. <SOA>Why don't you take the ring to [CHARACTER]?<EOA> [CHARACTER] knows the history of [PLACE] better than anyone. [CHARACTER] can be a bit difficult, but I'm sure [CHARACTER] will appreciate your help."
"[CHARACTER] the Fair is in charge of [PLACE]. Poor woman. Losing a husband and king like that. It was a dark day for us all. Damn, that reminds me, I have a delivery to make to [CHARACTER] steward. [CHARACTER] ordered a special bottle of [ITEM]. <SOA>You could deliver it for me. Save me a lot of trouble. Here. Take it to [PLACE].<EOA>"
"Everything you see is grown at my family's own [PLACE] Farm. Fresh and filling. I also do a little [ITEM] growing. The court wizard, [CHARACTER], pays us to plant a little [ITEM]. Who knows what [CHARACTER] uses it for? A poison like that? <SOA>Hey, could you deliver this bottle of [ITEM] extract to [CHARACTER]?<EOA>"
"My family has been breeding and training [ITEM] for years. You need one out in the wilderness. Don't want to be alone when some [ENEMY] comes swinging. I personally trained a whole litter for [CHARACTER] Jarl. That reminds me, I was going to deliver some [ITEM] to the Keep. Spiced beef. Their favorite. <SOA>You volunteer to make trip and deliver the [ITEM]?<EOA> Well, look at you, thanks. <SOA>Take it to [CHARACTER]<EOA>, [CHARACTER] handles all the [ITEM] for the Jarl."
"This mine is only a few [NUMBER] old, but I've been digging up [ITEM] for over a [NUMBER]. We're getting to the point where the tunnels are getting deep into the rock. People complain of bad coughs and foul air. I've seen this before. We need some [ITEM] to combat the [ITEM] dust. I was about to send a message to [PLACE] for aid. <SOA>Could you deliver that message on my behalf?<EOA> <SOA>Take it to [CHARACTER], in the [ITEM] Phial.<EOA>"
"My brother [CHARACTER] is... sensitive. He has trouble focusing his attention on things. We were taking him to the [PLACE] of Kynareth in [PLACE], just so the healers could make sure he was in good health, and they say he's fine. Are you heading to [PLACE]? <SOA>Could you take this letter to the priestess, [CHARACTER] Pure-Spring?<EOA> It's a note about [CHARACTER]'s health."
"Poor [CHARACTER] is stuck. Can't you see? I was transporting my dear, sweet mother. Well, not her. Her corpse! She's quite dead. I'm taking mother to a new home. A new crypt. But... aggh! Wagon wheel! Damnedest wagon wheel! It broke! Don't you see? Oh. Oh yes! Yes, the kindly stranger can certainly help! <SOA>Go to the farm - the [PLACE] Farm<EOA>. Just over there, off the road. <SOA>Talk to [CHARACTER]. He has tools!<EOA> He can help me! But he won't! He refuses! <SOA>Convince [CHARACTER] to fix my wheel!<EOA> Do that, and poor [CHARACTER] will reward you. With [ITEM]"
"Alive.... You're alive... Thank [ENEMY]... Ssshhh.... Please. There is much... I have to say. And... not much time... I'm sorry. So very sorry. The [ENEMY]... [CHARACTER]... He said that by giving you to them, he would leave the Dark Brotherhood alone. Forever. By [ENEMY], I was such a fool. All of this... it's all my fault. You are the best of us, and I nearly killed you... as I've killed everyone else... I'm saying you were right. The Night Mother was right. The old ways... they guided the Dark Brotherhood for centuries. I was a fool to oppose them. And to prove my... sincerity, I have prayed for a contract. You lead this Family now. I give you the [ITEM] of Woe, so that you can see it through. <SOA>You must kill... Me.<EOA>"
"This is an important job. I have a competitor called [CHARACTER] Meadery that I want to put out of business. I also want to know how they managed to get the place up and running so quickly. Some layabout named [CHARACTER] runs the [CHARACTER] Meadery. Been a thorn in my side for the last few years now. With [CHARACTER] in prison, his meadery will be forced to close. Then I swoop in and take over the place. No more competition. <SOA>Head to the [PLACE] Mare in [PLACE] and look for [CHARACTER] Maccius<EOA>. He'll fill you in on all the details."
"It's about time you got here. I'm not accustomed to dealing with people who are unreliable. That's why I asked Delvin to send me his best. Nothing raises my ire more than having an agreement broken. It's bad for business and it wastes time. Captain [CHARACTER] of the Dainty Sload has decided to test my patience on this matter by neglecting to honor a trade agreement we had established. I need you to help me show him the error of his ways by sneaking on board the Sload and planting some contraband. <SOA>You'll need to get your hands on some [ITEM] from [CHARACTER] down by the docks<EOA>. She's the first mate on another ship, the Red Wave. Once you get your hands on it, <SOA>I want you to plant it in Captain [CHARACTER]'s footlocker<EOA>. I'll take care of the rest. Captain [CHARACTER] is ashore right now and I want the authorities waiting for him when he gets back. Now get going... I don't want to see your face until the job's done."
"Please, our tribe suffers and we need help. Our Chief, [CHARACTER], was once a strong and proud warrior. Now he is stricken, cursed. He is weak, and so our tribe is weak. The [ENEMY] sense this, and intrude on our territory. Now they assault our very home. [CHARACTER] refuses help, but I sense that you may be just what we need. He has demanded we stay inside the walls. We cannot leave. I must petition [ENEMY] for relief. This curse must be lifted. But I cannot travel to [ENEMY]'s shrine. The ritual must be done here, and I do not have the materials I need. I beg of you, <SOA>can you bring me [ITEM] Fat and a [ENEMY] Heart?<EOA> I have no wish to depend on a stranger, but I have no choice."
"You are exactly what I was looking for. You see, my name is [CHARACTER]. And I have a problem I think you can help sort out. My master and I had a bit of a falling out. We got into an argument and it got rather... heated. He's kicked me out until I find someone who can settle our disagreement. That's where you come in. My master is [CHARACTER], the prince of wishes. As you can imagine, he's quite the important person. Now, since he banished me, [CHARACTER]'s been rather weak. He can't manifest very far from one of his shrines. I know there's a cult that worships him at [PLACE]. <SOA>We should be able to talk to him there<EOA>. If this works out, I'll make sure you're rewarded. Just don't trust any offer he makes you... okay?"
"<SOA>Get over to [PLACE]<EOA>. Rumor has it the Jarl's Steward, [CHARACTER], is a faithful [ITEM] worshiper, if not a true son of [PLACE] - he still supports the Empire, after all. But, if confronted with proof of his belief, you might be able to 'persuade' him to aid our cause, indirectly of course. Wouldn't want to sully his reputation, would we? You'll need to be careful with this one. The Jarl's men won't look kindly on you rummaging through the steward's quarters."
"Passing through on your way to [PLACE]? About to make a delivery up there myself. I mostly deliver [ITEM] supplies like dried fish and salted meats; you know, things that keep fresh for a long time. The [ENEMY] tend not to get out much, if you catch my meaning. It's kind of an understanding between us. I mean, it just wouldn't feel right to charge them for a bit of preserved [ITEM]. Trouble is, my legs aren't what they used to be and climbing the [NUMBER] Steps takes its toll. <SOA>You'd like to make the delivery for me?<EOA> Really? That would be kind of you. Here, take this bag of [ITEM]. At the top of the steps you'll see the offering chest. Just leave the bag inside and you're done."
"The Ancestral Tombs are where we inter our dead. They are sacred places, meant to honor their passing. Sadly, we've been unable to use the Ancestral Tomb beneath the [PLACE] as of late, and have resorted to other locations to scatter the remains. Those foul vermin... the abominations we call [ENEMY] have risen from the ashes of our own ancestors. They're befouling the memories of our forefathers by defiling their remains. <SOA>Could you cleanse the tomb for us, wanderer?<EOA> That would be most kind. Here, this key should open the door to the tomb."
"I've got a bit of an errand to perform, but I need an extra pair of hands. And in my line of work, extra hands are well-paid. It's simple... I'm going to cause a distraction and <SOA>you're going to steal [ITEM]'s<EOA> silver ring from a strongbox under his stand. Once you have it, <SOA>I want you to place it in [CHARACTER]'s pocket without him noticing<EOA>. There's someone that wants to see [CHARACTER] put out of business permanently. That's all you need to know. Now, you tell me when you're ready and we'll get started."
"I hate [CHARACTER]! It's everything about [CHARACTER]. [CHARACTER]'s disgusting. I think [CHARACTER] takes [CHARACTER]'s worship of [ITEM] a bit too seriously. Do you know [CHARACTER]'s slept with [NUMBER] different [ENEMY] in the last [NUMBER] alone? What kind of a [CHARACTER] would do such a thing? Just for once, I'd like to see [CHARACTER] squirm... to rub [CHARACTER]'s nose in it. Actually, there is a way to do this, but I don't think I could get away with doing it. [CHARACTER]'d kill me if [CHARACTER] found out. You see, I happen to know after [CHARACTER] makes love, [CHARACTER] gives [CHARACTER]'s partner a token of [CHARACTER]'s affection called a Mark of [ITEM]. If you confront [CHARACTER] with [NUMBER] of the Marks of [ITEM], [CHARACTER]'d be so embarrassed... well, I don't know what [CHARACTER]'d do! Oh, this is going to be great! <SOA>You need to get the Marks of [ITEM] from [CHARACTER], [CHARACTER] and [CHARACTER]<EOA>. Not sure how you're going to do that, but try your best. Then just confront [CHARACTER] with them and the rest works itself out."
"Letter from [CHARACTER] by [CHARACTER] Dragonborn, It has come to my attention you may have recently acquired a certain Dwemer sword from [PLACE]. I'm not sure how such an object came to find itself resting there... but I've been trying to obtain one for my research. <SOA>If you still have it, or if not, find another one, I would be most appreciative if you were to bring it to me here in [PLACE]<EOA>. I will pay handsomely. Sincerely, [CHARACTER]"
"I've been having difficulties with my heart stone experiments. Have you heard of the Briarhearts? They are fierce warriors of the [ENEMY] tribes. They actually remove their own hearts, and replace them with large briar seeds. It puts their lifesparks in direct connection to the natural forces. Well, I'm hoping to do something similar... if I could connect a living being to the forces of nature... well... that would be formidable. I've done some experiments in this area, but, well, my test subjects are far too fragile. I'm hoping to learn some of the Briarheart techniques, their methods. <SOA>I need you to examine one of them. Just investigate as much as you can<EOA>. The [ENEMY] live in the hills on the western edge of [PLACE]. From there, you're on your own. I'm given to understand that they are not difficult to find, if you gather my inference."
"The Necromancer [CHARACTER] defiles my shrine with vile corruptions, trapping lost souls left in the wake of this war to do his bidding. Worse still, he uses the power stored within my own token to fuel his foul deeds. Mortals call my token [ITEM], for it was forged in a holy light that breaks upon my foes, burning away corruption and false life. <SOA>You will enter my shrine, destroy [CHARACTER], and retrieve this mighty [ITEM]<EOA>. I have brought you here, mortal, to be my champion. You will do this. I have commanded it!"
"A few days ago, some thieves from [PLACE] broke in here and stole it! Can you imagine? Took the only thing of value we had. It was a family heirloom. I can't even put a price on how much that thing means to me. I'm sure that they are from [PLACE]. I bumped into them when I was coming back to my farm after buying supplies. I know those lowlifes took it with them back to the Ratway. They left an unmistakable stench behind. <SOA>If you have the guts to head into the Ratway and get my [ITEM] back<EOA>, I'll pay you what I can. It would be nice to have it back... means a lot to me."
"Dear sibling. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure [CHARACTER] indicated. With the Emperor's arrival in [PLACE] now a certainty, his security service, the Penitus Oculatus, will need to begin its preparations immediately. Security is being handled by a Commander [CHARACTER]. [CHARACTER] and I have devised a plan to break the man, and in doing so, cripple the Emperor's protection. You are to slay the commander's son, [CHARACTER], and once he is dead, plant false evidence on his body implicating him in a plot to kill the Emperor. He is set to leave the Penitus Oculatus outpost at [PLACE], and inspect the security of each city in [PLACE]. <SOA>Go there now. Observe [CHARACTER]'s departure, and follow him<EOA>. Waylay him in one of the cities, and send his soul to Sithis. Once he's dead, plant the incriminating letter on his body, and let fate take care of the rest. Oh, and one final thing... To earn your bonus, do not kill [CHARACTER] in [PLACE], or on the road. <SOA>Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting<EOA>. There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating [CHARACTER] in the plot to assassinate the Emperor. Do that, and [CHARACTER] has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to [CHARACTER] the Feeble, in [PLACE]. [CHARACTER] is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up."
"Splendid. We're ready to begin. Or, more specifically, you're ready to begin. After all, you're the one the Night Mother spoke to. Now then. I hope you have something nice to wear. Because you're going to a wedding. Well, more like the public reception. It should be a lovely affair. <SOA>You'll mingle with the guests, eat some cake... stab the bride. Oh yes. You've got to kill the bride<EOA>. At her wedding. And they say romance is dead. Your target's name is [CHARACTER]. She oversees the [ENEMY]'s business holdings in [PLACE]. The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want. [CHARACTER] is the first cousin to our dear Emperor, Titus Mede II. [CHARACTER] has obvious Imperial connections. Her husband has ties to the Stormcloaks. Their union is a step toward reconciliation. So if there's a murder at the wedding... Not only will it stall the peace process - it will send shockwaves throughout the entire Empire. The Emperor's hand will be forced. He'll have to travel to [PLACE] to deal with the aftermath... and he'll find the Dark Brotherhood waiting. [CHARACTER] is likely to address her guests frequently, as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise you a significant bonus. Now go. And give the city of [PLACE] a celebration they're not likely to forget."
"I could use someone to fetch something for me. Well, when I say fetch, I really mean delve into a dangerous ruin in search of an ancient stone tablet that may or may not actually be there. I, ah, learned of a certain stone tablet said to be housed in [PLACE] - a '[ITEM],' said to contain a map of dragon burial sites. <SOA>Go to [PLACE], find this tablet<EOA> - no doubt interred in the main chamber - and bring it to me. Simplicity itself."
"Another girl killed. The victim is [CHARACTER], from [PLACE] Hall. Served me a drink just a few nights ago... but I can't say I knew her. She was killed the same way as the other two girls. Looks like she was stabbed, and then cut apart. It's like an [ENEMY] got to her, but these are the wounds of a blade. You could help us with the investigation. We're stretched thin as it is with the war. Nobody has the time to spend on this. Not pleasant, but it's the truth. Here are some starting points for you. I noticed a trail of blood leading away from here. Helgird's taken [CHARACTER]'s body into the [PLACE] of the Dead to prepare for burial. She's a little crazy, but if she knows anything, it's dead bodies."
"[CHARACTER] has seen your coming, traveler. It was not curiosity, but fate, that has led you here. [CHARACTER] has given me the gift of foresight. I had a vision of you walking up the steps to this altar long before you were born. You have been chosen to be her champion. I know it is unexpected, but do not worry. It will all unfold as she has predicted. <SOA>You must go to a [PLACE], endangered by water, yet untouched by it<EOA>. Inside, you will find an elven mage who can turn the brightest star as black as night. It is cryptic, I know, but [CHARACTER]'s signs are never wrong. I believe the [PLACE] may refer to [PLACE]. Ask if they know this elven enchanter."
"I know things. Hidden things. Things you aren't supposed to know. I'm not alright! No! That's what I'm trying to say. The secrets. They're in there. In there deep. Can't get them out. They're in my head. They might leak out. Don't want them crawling into your head, too. Like me. The [ITEM] Book taught me the secrets. It shoved them in my head. With black slick fingers. My fingers are too short. I can't get them out. I didn't find the [ITEM] Book. It found me. Here. I'll show you. See. Right there, in [PLACE] Barrow. But don't go there. You don't want these things in your head. You don't!"
"What? A [ENEMY]? In [PLACE]? That explains what I saw earlier... a [ENEMY] flying down from the south... I was hoping I was wrong about what I thought it was... Didn't want to believe my own eyes, is all. The Jarl needs to know if there's a [ENEMY] on the loose. [PLACE] is defenseless... <SOA>We need to get word to Jarl [CHARACTER] in [PLACE] to send whatever soldiers he can<EOA>. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt."
"All right. It's time to deliver the final blow to the [ENEMY] rebellion. You all have fought bravely, and sacrificed much to bring us to this point. [CHARACTER] thinks he can hide behind the walls of his castle. But we will fight our way in and drag him out through the rubble to face justice. Because this is the end for them, the [ENEMY] will fight like cornered rats. They will be fierce and crafty. But they are no match for Legionnaires. You are the best and the brightest warriors in Tamriel. Professional soldiers, fearless and devastating. The Emperor will be paying close attention to what happens here today. Men who distinguish themselves will be well rewarded. Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion!"
"This is it men! This is an important day for the Empire and for the Legion. And for all of [PLACE]. This is the day we send a message to [CHARACTER] and the rebel Jarls who support him. We will protect [PLACE] from [ENEMY]. But make no mistake. What we do here today, we do for [PLACE] and her people. By cutting out the disease of this rebellion, we will make this country whole again! Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion!"
"You're here! And not a moment too soon. If anything should happen to [CHARACTER], there'll be hell to pay. [CHARACTER]'s a close friend of mine. We fought together on the battlefield for many years until old age got the better of us. Now it's up to me to save him one more time... this time from the executioner's block in [PLACE]. The city guard in [PLACE] is seeking [CHARACTER] for a serious crime. When he fled here, he was arrested for drunken behavior. Can you imagine? Fortunately, his identity isn't known to the authorities in [PLACE], so there's still a chance to save him. The job is two-fold. First, steal a letter that was sent from [PLACE] warning [PLACE]'s guard to be on the lookout for [CHARACTER]. The second is to change [CHARACTER]'s name in the prison registry to his new identity. The job is relatively difficult. If it was easy, I would have hired a local thug instead of a professional from the Thieves Guild. You see both of these items are kept inside [PLACE], and they don't allow visitors inside the Jarl's or the Steward's chambers. One more thing. If you get caught, I can't afford to be connected to you. Remember that before you do anything stupid."
"I picked up a trick from a master butcher. He showed me a way to grind up ice wraith teeth and use it as a preservative. Keeps everything cold and fresh, but only for a limited time. I'm always looking to replenish my supply, so <SOA>if you ever come across [NUMBER] of them, I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands<EOA>. The last traveler that traded me some said he found them at a [PLACE] called [PLACE]. Careful though, rumor has it a dragon makes its home there."
"I could use some help with getting organized. An assistant perhaps? No, no, no. Maybe a familiar. No, too messy. Well, at any rate, organization is not my strong suit. Not at all. I need as much help as I can get. In fact, <SOA>if you could retrieve a few things for me, I could start on my next set of experiments. What I need is my [ITEM], my [ITEM] and my [ITEM]<EOA>. In fact, I could use them immediately. Well... why are you still standing here? Oh, right. You need to know where they are! That would help. Let's see. Last time I used the [ITEM] was at my dear friend [CHARACTER]'s house in [PLACE]... [PLACE] I believe it's called. The [ITEM] should still be in [PLACE] at the [PLACE]. I don't know why I didn't just take it with me. And last is the gem. I left that one in [PLACE] at the [PLACE] alchemy shop. It was a good trade too. Ah well. <SOA>Bring those items back to me and I'll be happy to experiment on you<EOA>. No, no... that isn't right. I'd be happy to reward you."
"Excuse me, but do you know anything about this [PLACE]? Seen anyone enter or leave? Seems no one in this [PLACE] has. I'm with the [ENEMY] of [ENEMY]. We believe this [PLACE] might have been used for [ENEMY] worship. Evil rites and so forth. I was actually just about to head on inside. Be good to have someone watch my back. [ENEMY] are powerful creatures and tricksters. Never know what you'll find."
"Fool! Did you think [ENEMY], the Lord of Domination, would so easily reward you? What do you see from that little cage? Speak. You definitely see the spikes of your cage. Sharp, aren't they? This was the last thing many saw before they were sacrificed in my name. But even a god has his enemies, and my rival [ENEMY] had her priest desecrate it. So long since it's tasted blood. Until you came. I want submission. I want the priest who did this to bend his knee and give me his soul. He comes by to perform [ENEMY]'s insulting rites at my altar, but he's been missing. Captured and bound. Left to rot. You'll get the freedom your kind enjoys so much. <SOA>Save the priest. Let him perform his rite one more time<EOA>. And when he does, we will be waiting for him. Then you will be finally rewarded. The [ITEM] of [ENEMY]! I give you its true power, mortal. When your enemies lie broken and bloody before you, know that I will be watching."
"You are now ready for your last trial. <SOA>Retrieve the [ITEM] of [CHARACTER] Windcaller, our founder, from his tomb in the ancient fane of [PLACE]<EOA>. Remain true to the Way of the Voice, and you will return. Then it is time for us to recognize you formally as [CHARACTER]."
"My job at the [PLACE] Fishery is in danger. The owner, [CHARACTER], said that if I show up for work in this condition one more time, then I'm out. I don't mean to do this to myself, but I can't help it. I tried some Skooma a year ago, and ever since then, I can't stop! <SOA>If you could give me a healing [ITEM]<EOA>, I could cleanse this poison from my body and get back to my life."
"I'm running low on [ITEM] Stones. If you have any with you, I'll buy one. Otherwise, I can tell you where you might find one. Every time the Red [PLACE] belches, more of them land here on Solstheim. <SOA>Look around for impact craters, exposed rock, that sort of thing<EOA>. You may need to pick away at it to pry the heart stone itself loose, but you look... strong. Good luck."
"I don't care if [CHARACTER]'s a master wizard. [CHARACTER] can't treat me like this! Master [CHARACTER], that fetcher, told me to fix [CHARACTER]'s house. If I don't, [CHARACTER]'ll find a new mycologist who will. Decades of loyal service, and [CHARACTER]'d just throw me out like yesterday's breakfast! <SOA>I need [NUMBER] taproots soaked in the headwaters of the [PLACE] river to fix [CHARACTER]'s tower<EOA>. I'm an old woman. I can't possibly make that trip. It's way too dangerous. If you get some taproots, I'll pay you to dip them in the headwaters and bring them to me."
"The [PLACE] Wind is my mistress, and I'm her master. I don't tolerate any disloyalty. You looking for work? Got a sailor who thought running a gang of thieves would be more money than hauling my cargo. <SOA>You make an example of that gang<EOA>, I'll give you [NUMBER]'s worth of pay. Don't spend it all on mead."
"Cleaning out the forge was the easy part. But those blasted [ENEMY] made off with most of my materials. And I can't forge air. You tend to wander around, don't you? If you come across any [ITEM] or [ITEM] in your travels, bring them back to old [CHARACTER]. Help each other out."
"The [PLACE] is still in [PLACE], but not for long. [CHARACTER]'s onboard [CHARACTER]'s ship, the [PLACE], moored offshore in the [PLACE] inlet. But you must hurry! If you can get onboard that ship. <SOA>Kill [CHARACTER] [NUMBER], as contracted...<EOA> I will reveal the location of the dead drop that holds your payment. This is the true [CHARACTER], not some half-penny lookalike. [CHARACTER]'ll be surrounded by elite bodyguards, I'm sure. You'll have your work cut out for you. Still... everyone assumes the [ENEMY] has been completely destroyed. They may be a bit more lax than usual."
"Have you ever seen what a bear does to the trees? They jump up on their hind legs and scratch them to bits... marking their territory or something. It's getting to the point where I have to scour [PLACE] for untouched trees at the right size. Costs me too much time and money. Tell you what. <SOA>Bring me [NUMBER] of bear pelts from anywhere in [PLACE]<EOA> I'll gladly pay you for thinning out the herd."
"My blade, the [ITEM], was lost years ago in a [PLACE]. Without it, I feel almost as defenseless as a newborn. I don't think I'll ever be able to find a replacement. I was adventuring in the depths of the ruins when I was attacked by a massive [ENEMY]... like nothing I had ever seen. When the colossus struck, [ITEM] was knocked from my grasp, and I was wounded badly. It was only through blind luck that I was able to crawl away from the [ENEMY] abomination and make my way to the surface. I couldn't ask you to undertake such a treacherous journey; it would be a fool's errand. But I see that spark in your eye, and I know better than to warn you away. [ITEM] rests with the [PLACE] ruin of [PLACE]. Tread carefully, friend... those same ruins almost took my life."
"I've given us a chance to speak privately, but I'm afraid I can't do this for long. We must be brief. The situation here at your [PLACE] is of dire importance, and attempts to contact you as we have previously have failed. I believe it is due to the very source of our concern. This object... The [ITEM] of [PLACE] as your people have taken to calling it. The energy coming from it has prevented us from reaching you with the visions you have already seen. The longer it remains here, the more dangerous the situation becomes. And so I have come here personally to tell you it must be dealt with. I fear I have already overstepped the bounds of my Order, but I will offer this: <SOA>seek out the [ENEMY] of [PLACE] here in your [PLACE]<EOA>. His perception may be more coherent than ours."
"We did have a bit of a... break-in. But we still have plenty to sell. [ENEMY] were only after one thing. An [ITEM], solid gold. In the shape of a [ENEMY]'s [ITEM]. I've got some coin coming in from my last shipment. It's yours if you <SOA>bring my [ITEM] back<EOA>. <SOA>If you're going after those [ENEMY], you should head to [PLACE]<EOA> Barrow, northeast of town."
"You don't remember me? Two campaigns we served together. You saved my life time and time again. You promised me. You promised that when we sacked [PLACE], you would make me your sworn brother. And I've waited. Even after the [ENEMY]' arrows dug into my chest and their hammers crushed my bones. I've waited. <SOA>Give me your sword<EOA>. That we may become brothers as you promised."
"You've got to help me! I conjured an [ENEMY] Guardian and now it's running amok in [PLACE]. Master [CHARACTER] refused to teach me the [ENEMY] Guardian spell. So I read his spell book on my own and learned it. Something went wrong when I cast it. The [ENEMY] is attacking everything in sight. I need to keep Master [CHARACTER] distracted so he doesn't find out what I did. There is no telling what he would do to me. <SOA>While you are taking care of the [ENEMY], I'll try to figure out what went wrong<EOA>. I don't have any gold to pay you with, but I can give you this [ITEM]."
"My mind weighs heavy enough. [CHARACTER]'s so lost in her visions, and it's only getting worse. I've looked after her safety for so long... If she can't tell what's real and what's not, how will she continue to lead [PLACE]? There is a letter, one I have had for some time now. I think it is time it gets delivered. I cannot leave [CHARACTER]'s side, so I must stay here. <SOA>Could you see that it reaches Captain [CHARACTER] in [PLACE]?<EOA> Please, do not open it. It is... private."
"This plague seems to specifically target beings of an inherently magical nature, such as the [ENEMY]. So far it's not affecting humans, so I've sent for a transport to bring us some medical supplies, and I'll be coordinating the medical relief here. <SOA>Meanwhile, you need to get out to the [PLACE] Temple<EOA>. Take [PLACE]' Pass to the Frosted Hills. <SOA>Try to catch up to the Grand Regent before he enters the temple<EOA>."
"Someone needs to warn the [ENEMY]. <SOA>Head up the pass to their [PLACE]<EOA>. <SOA>Find my old friend, [CHARACTER], and let her know what happened<EOA>. Tell them that the Alchemist destroyed Torchlight, and is headed their way. He may be there already..."
"[ENEMY] the Mauler must have slipped away during the attack and concealed himself in the underground slave den! And, if the captives are there as well, [ENEMY] must be holding them hostage! <SOA>You must defeat [ENEMY] and free the captives<EOA>, or all that has been done to stop the slavers will have been for naught!"
"Please, help me! Our dear little ones wandered into that [PLACE]! My husband [CHARACTER] ventured after them, but it is crawling with nasty [ENEMY], and he hasn't returned! My husband [CHARACTER] and I were on our way to the [PLACE]ian Enclave. We're homesteaders, with a small farm in the Frosted Hills. The weather is getting harsh, so we were making one last run for supplies before winter. Oh, I'm beside myself with worry! <SOA>Please, find [CHARACTER] and our precious babies!<EOA> You have to help us! You could have a special [ITEM] as a token of our gratitude!"
"BOUNTY! The [ENEMY] raiders are a threat to the [PLACE]ians and to the brave settlers of the Empire. Commander [CHARACTER] is authorized to pay a reward to anyone who assists the Vanquisher Corps in ridding the [PLACE] Steppes of these savage brutes. This bounty shall be paid to anyone who slays [NUMBER] or more [ENEMY] in the [PLACE] Steppes."
"BOUNTY! Commander [CHARACTER] of the Vanquisher Corps is offering a reward to anyone who can <SOA>help thin out the packs of [ENEMY]<EOA> hampering colonization and <SOA>defense efforts in [PLACE]<EOA>. This reward shall be paid to anyone who slays [NUMBER] or more [ENEMY] in the [PLACE] Steppes."
"Commander [CHARACTER] believes that the [CHARACTER] might attack the Wellspring [PLACE], in an attempt to reach the [CHARACTER]... for what nefarious purpose I am afraid to speculate. There has been no word from either [CHARACTER], or the Guardian. <SOA>Scout the Wellspring [PLACE], and determine if the Guardian of Water is in any danger.<EOA>"
"The [CHARACTER] must be stopped before [CHARACTER] attacks any more Guardians! Each time [CHARACTER] siphons off our energy, [CHARACTER] becomes more dangerous. <SOA>You and Commander [CHARACTER] should return the [PLACE], and plan your next move.<EOA>"
"I've been performing a little research on the [ITEM]. I believe we can prolong its salutary effects if we infuse it with potent vampiric blood. I've located the petrified remains of an elder [ENEMY] in [PLACE]. <SOA>Bring them to me<EOA>, and I should be able to extend the effects granted by the [ITEM]."
"Lord [CHARACTER]. Remember your place. Now, he wants the [ITEM], then. You've heard of the [ITEM]? The [ITEM] has been in Lord [CHARACTER]'s possession for quite some time now. It is, when used properly, able to increase the potency of our powers. Lord [CHARACTER] has neglected using the [ITEM] for ages. If he wants it filled now, then grander things are afoot. This is good. <SOA>Follow me. I'll take you to the [ITEM].<EOA>"
"I've discovered the whereabouts of a [ENEMY] lair at [PLACE]'s Lair. Destroying the head [ENEMY] is usually sufficient to scatter its minions, though it's best to destroy every last one of them. I suspect there's more wherever he came from. We cannot afford to relax."
"You know how to use an [ITEM] lab right? <SOA>Mix a couple of [ITEM] together, see what happens<EOA>. A little [ITEM] and [ITEM] makes a healing [ITEM], if you didn't know. There's plenty of [ITEM] for sale, too."
"Can you help me? There's a [ENEMY] in the [PLACE]; doing Gods know what with my dead relatives. The [ENEMY]'s called [CHARACTER] [CHARACTER]. My family has never really seen eye to eye with him and he has finally gone off the deep end. He's gone in to defile our family [PLACE] by using our ancestors for his filthy dark elf necromancy. My aunt went in after him, but she hasn't come out yet and I'm afraid to go in by myself. I'm not proud of it. I'm terrified of that [PLACE] and Aunt [CHARACTER] knows it. My Da locked me in there in a drunken rage when he left us... three days in there eating the offerings left for our dead before Aunt [CHARACTER] found me. I'll unlock the door and meet you inside, <SOA>then you can lead the way<EOA>. We should get after [CHARACTER] before he does more damage here."
"Hello! I thought I heard someone moving around out there. Listen, my name's [CHARACTER]. I got ambushed by some [ENEMY], and managed to get clear... but I got pretty badly injured in the process. I can treat it, but I need some [ITEM]. They grow around here, but I'm too weak to look for them. <SOA>Think you can find some for me, bring 'em back here?<EOA> You'll be rewarded, I promise."
"Greetings, my friend! Welcome to [PLACE]! I am [CHARACTER]. I speak for the [PLACE]. As you know, the [ENEMY] are preparing to assault our [PLACE]. Our military leader, Commander [CHARACTER], has apparently been captured by the [ENEMY], out in the [PLACE]. They'll have sent for soldiers to take their prisoners back to their stronghold. Once they get [CHARACTER] to [PLACE], they'll identify [CHARACTER] quickly enough, and then they'll interrogate [CHARACTER] until they know everything about our defenses. I believe you're going out to the [PLACE], the vast desert. <SOA>Please, rescue [CHARACTER]. We need [CHARACTER]<EOA>."
"Oh, thank you so much! Here I was, afraid I'd never enchant anything ever again! I'm was on my way to the [PLACE] Enclave when these [ENEMY] ambushed me. Once I gather my wits, I'll head over there. <SOA>Come by and see me, if you get a chance!<EOA> I'll have a reward for you."
"Your timing is perfect, my friend! Below us, in the [PLACE], the [ENEMY] is negotiating with a representative of the [ENEMY], to provide the [ENEMY] with a huge cache of [ITEM] they have salvaged. The [ENEMY] will use that [ITEM] to forge more arms to bring against us! They must be stopped! I beg you: <SOA>Go down into the [PLACE] and prevent the [ENEMY] from concluding [CHARACTER]'s negotiations with the [ENEMY]!<EOA> I realize this is not much in the way of a reward, but this [ITEM] is all I can offer."
"Oh, [CHARACTER], my poor [CHARACTER] - I cannot believe that [CHARACTER] is gone! Dear [CHARACTER]... <SOA>Please try to retrieve the [ITEM]<EOA> - it belonged to [CHARACTER]. I cannot bear to think that it is lost in this foul [PLACE], corroding away in swamp water. [CHARACTER] must have dropped it somewhere around here..."
"Please, [CHARACTER]! Wait a moment! I am [CHARACTER] - a traveler from [PLACE]. My [CHARACTER] and I came to this [PLACE] to recover an ancient [ITEM] - the [ITEM] - which is said to have power over death itself. We sought to bring it to the [PLACE] for study. [CHARACTER] entered the catacombs while I tended our camp - but [CHARACTER] has not returned, and there are [ENEMY] stirring below. Please - <SOA>I only ask that you discover [CHARACTER]'s fate<EOA> - perhaps [CHARACTER] is wounded and only needs aid to escape! If the worst comes to pass... [CHARACTER] wears a [ITEM] around [CHARACTER]'s neck, and you will know [CHARACTER] by it."
"It's good to see you again, my friend! I know that I promised you a greater reward, should you come to visit... but that was before I returned to the [PLACE] and found the [PLACE] under siege by [ENEMY]. What if I give you your choice of [ITEM] from the [PLACE]? The [PLACE] houses some of the finest [ITEM] in the world! You have but to use the [ITEM] to get inside, <SOA>then activate the [PLACE] Portal<EOA>, which will allow us to gather up the [ITEM] and [ITEM] safely... with the [ENEMY] none the wiser!"
"I have continued studying the crests, and I am more convinced than ever that the [ITEM] is hidden in the [PLACE]. <SOA>If you can retrieve it, I can bring it back to [PLACE]<EOA>, to aid in the city's defense against the [ENEMY] siege."
"My friend, thank you for coming to our aid. I am Lord [CHARACTER], the leader of this [PLACE] envoy, sent to procure the [PLACE]'s aid in our upcoming war with the [ENEMY]. Grand Regent [CHARACTER] gave us leave to search the [PLACE] for the [ITEM], and we had narrowed our search to these chilly hills before we were assaulted by these [ENEMY]. Now we are too injured to continue our search. <SOA>Can you aid us?<EOA> The exact location of the [ITEM] is long forgotten, but the [PLACE] created a map from three crests. If you can find those, I can interpret the map and find the [ITEM]! Search the [PLACE] for the crests. Bring them to me, and I will reward you, on behalf of the [PLACE] people."
"Thank the Gods you're here! These... [ENEMY] just came out of nowhere! I've been able to hold them off so far, but, with you here, we'll soon triumph over them! Why are you looking at me like that? Can't you see them? They're all around us! Please... you've got to believe me!"
"Listen: If you're headed out to the [PLACE], there's something you should know. We were surveying out there, and discovered some kind of... hole, in thin air, in the pit mine we've been calling [PLACE]. The hole is very small, right now, but we could see things inside... powerful things, but horrible. Malign. If you're going out there, see if you can find the hole. If we're lucky, it disappeared. But, if not, <SOA>you should do your best to find a way to close it<EOA>, before the things we saw get through!"
"If you're heading out into the [PLACE], could you find out what happened to my companion [CHARACTER]? [CHARACTER] left with a crew to determine why the [ENEMY] have become so aggressive lately, but no one has come back. If you travel North to the [PLACE] Stacks, you should be able to find [CHARACTER] - or at least what happened to [CHARACTER]."
"I fear the [CHARACTER] is a pawn of the [ENEMY]. With the power of the Guardians, a portal to the Nether Realm could be thrown wide, and the world would be plunged into an age of never-ending torment. Return to the [PLACE] immediately. Commander [CHARACTER] can help you secure passage to the [PLACE], where two of my fellow Guardians can be found. <SOA>Stop the [CHARACTER] before [CHARACTER] can drain them as well!<EOA>"
"I'm so relieved you have arrived! My crew and I journeyed to this outpost to deal with the increasingly aggressive [ENEMY]. I remained here to fashion additional explosives while my crew investigated the stacks, but they never returned. I have been unable to leave here because of the swarming [ENEMY]. <SOA>Please take these explosives with you and journey to [PLACE]<EOA>, <SOA>and search for any surviving [CHARACTER] and help them in any way you can!<EOA>"
"I've been charged with culling the [ENEMY] here, for the Imperial colonization effort. I can keep their population down, but something is driving them wild, almost like they're rabid or something. <SOA>Can you get into the [ENEMY] den, in the [PLACE], and get rid of whatever's making them so vicious?<EOA>"
"Your arrival is well-timed. I believe I have located the [CHARACTER]'s lair, here in the [PLACE] Caverns. I found a Journal just inside the entrance; it speaks of entering the mine at [PLACE] and retrieving [CHARACTER]'s Heart. I intended to look for more, further inside the icy caverns, but the creatures dwelling there now are too much for me. Finding the rest of the [CHARACTER]'s Journals would probably be very helpful in ascertaining how to stop [CHARACTER]. The one I saw was volume four, so there are probably three more in the [PLACE] Caverns."
"I fear the [ENEMY] is a pawn of the Netherim. With the power of the [ENEMY], a portal to the [PLACE] Realm could be thrown wide, and the world would be plunged into an age of never-ending torment. <SOA>Return to the [PLACE] immediately<EOA>. [CHARACTER] Vale can help you secure passage to the [PLACE] Wastes, where two of my fellow [ENEMY] can be found. <SOA>Stop the [ENEMY] before [NUMBER] can drain them as well!<EOA>"
"We are relatively safe here, but the brutish [ENEMY] will surely destroy everything that isn't made of gold! The [PLACE] is home to thousands of years of historical artifacts and documents, and it grieves me immeasurably to think of all of those treasures lost! We were able to gather up some of the artifacts, as we fled, but the [ITEM] Head of [PLACE] was left behind! <SOA>Please, find it!<EOA> Some of its records are the only accounts we have of major historic events!"
"Thank the Gods you are here! A plague is sweeping through the [PLACE] Temple, transforming the temple priests into Nether-Thralls! Several uninfected priests are still inside, trapped by the [PLACE]. I can protect them, if I can reach them... or if they can reach me. <SOA>Look for [PLACE]<EOA> where the temple priests may have hidden from the Nether-Thralls, and send them back here. Once [NUMBER] are all safe, we can focus on aiding the Guardian of the [PLACE]."
"You're the one the [CHARACTER] told me about, then? Alright... whenever you're ready to get rollin', <SOA>we'll get your gear aboard our [PLACE]<EOA>, and we'll set out to [PLACE]. Shouldn't take us more than a couple of [NUMBER] to get there!"
"Ah, [CHARACTER] sent you with some [ITEM]s. Finally some good news! Don't bother looking for the rest of the crew - I'm the only one that survived. There's something wrong with some of the [ENEMY] hives - they seem to be infected. <SOA>You'll need to locate the rigged hives and detonate them<EOA>, <SOA>then descend into the Brood Hive itself and destroy any infected eggs you find<EOA>. Perhaps you will discover what has been blighting the eggs! This is a great task, but it must be done. We will all be in your debt."
"I have been dead a very long time, and in all those centuries, I have not found one soul worthy of taking up the mantle of hero, as I once did, and seeking adventure. Will you be that hero? I offer you five challenges. <SOA>Defeat each of the five Spectral Champions in [PLACE]'s<EOA> Pass: these ghostly champions will be your challenges. Should you master them all, my most prized possession is yours..."
"Your arrival is well-timed. I believe I have located the [CHARACTER]'s lair, here in the [PLACE] Caverns. I found a Journal just inside the entrance; it speaks of <SOA>entering the mine at [PLACE] and retrieving [CHARACTER]'s Heart<EOA>. I intended to look for more, further inside the icy caverns, but the [ENEMY] dwelling there now are too much for me. Finding the rest of the [CHARACTER]'s Journals would probably be very helpful in ascertaining how to stop [CHARACTER]. The one I saw was volume four, so there are probably three more in the [PLACE] Caverns."
"You survived the [ENEMY] more or less in one piece. Congratulations. But it occurs to me that you didn't do anything that you wouldn't ordinarily have done. This second task should prove much more amusing. <SOA>Step through the [PLACE]<EOA>. Your second task... is to survive!"
"You ... you came to rescue us? Thank the guardians! I've managed to keep [ENEMY] and [ENEMY] safe up here, but I injured my leg. I can't make my way out of this [PLACE] while carrying them. <SOA>If you'll take them to [PLACE]<EOA>, I'll follow you out at my own pace. <SOA>Tell [CHARACTER] that I'm okay<EOA>. My thanks to you for your help!"
"So... you come seeking the wealth of [CHARACTER]? My spoils are vast, and have no peer in this realm. There is no path to success for you, lest you <SOA>survive my arena and prove your worth<EOA>. Be forewarned - many have tested their mettle on this bloodstained floor, but none have yet succeeded. Their souls are now mine, and they do as they are bid. Will you attempt the challenge? I will await your decision. None have yet triumphed within the walls of my arena. Perhaps you will be the first? Perhaps..."
"We must act quickly. It appears that the [CHARACTER] you defeated in the [PLACE] has enslaved the Guardian of [ITEM] for the [ENEMY]. The most pressing danger is that they will use the enslaved Guardian to corrupt... and control... all the world's [ITEM]. Our only recourse in that event may be to destroy the Guardian. There might still be hope. <SOA>If we can find a way to free the Guardian from [ENEMY]'s control<EOA>, we can thwart the [CHARACTER]'s plans."
"Finally saved! Thank you! You look like a [CHARACTER] who likes risk! I'm heading back to [PLACE] now. <SOA>Meet me there<EOA> and see if your luck holds out!"
"Thank you for rescuing me. I had recovered the [ITEM] from these [ENEMY], but they captured me as I was trying to return to the [PLACE]. I could use your help with one small matter before you go. These [ENEMY] have been harrying the [PLACE] for several weeks now. You defeated many, but there are many more watching us from the safety of those huts. <SOA>Burn them out!<EOA> If they are allowed to remain, the [PLACE] will never be safe."
"I was planning to enter the [PLACE] Portal in the Old [PLACE] Refuge. Unfortunately, the keys have been stolen. [ENEMY] miners took one, and we believe that some [ENEMY] who recently moved into the area have the other. It takes both keys to activate the [PLACE] Portal... and it is beyond my abilities to retrieve them. <SOA>Recover the [ITEM] from the [ENEMY], and the [ITEM] from the [ENEMY]<EOA>. You can use them to open the Portal in the Refuge."
"I am bound to this [PLACE], and may not pass beyond the threshold. If you seek my remains, <SOA>you must find the [ITEM]<EOA> - they may be found in the depths beyond. Place them upon these altars, and the path to the [ENEMY] will be revealed. If you can best [ENEMY], you will discover my remains there - and the [ITEM] Jessa seeks."
"I am [CHARACTER] - why have you summoned me? Ah, you want to enter [CHARACTER]'s hidden realm. Yes, I know the way - but I do not provide service without compensation. I have very particular... appetites. The remains of the living are infused with a lingering residue of deeds past, which sustains me. <SOA>Bring me the skulls of four warriors of renown<EOA>, and I will take you where you wish to go. This battlefield is littered with the bones of great heroes. Your search should not be difficult."
"Well, well. You are much more determined... and capable... than I had suspected! Excellent... Now, to your final task. If you truly wish to free the [ENEMY], <SOA>you must humiliate my old rival, [CHARACTER], by stealing his precious [ITEM]<EOA>. Be warned: [CHARACTER] draws his power from the same source as the [ENEMY]. His realm borders closely on theirs; they will almost certainly stand against you, <SOA>should you challenge the [CHARACTER].<EOA>"
"My blade, [ITEM], was lost years ago in a [PLACE]. Without it, I feel almost as defenseless as a newborn. I don't think I'll ever be able to find a replacement. I was adventuring in the depths of the [PLACE] when I was attacked by a massive [ENEMY]... like nothing I had ever seen. When the colossus struck, [ITEM] was knocked from my grasp and I was wounded badly. It was only through blind luck that I was able to crawl away from the [ENEMY] abomination and make my way to the surface. I couldn't ask you to undertake such a treacherous journey, it would be a fool's errand. But I see that spark in your eye and I know better than to warn you away. <SOA>[ITEM] rests with the [PLACE] ruin of [PLACE]. Tread carefully, friend...<EOA> those same ruins almost took my life."
"I've given us a chance to speak privately, but I'm afraid I can't do this for long. We must be brief. The situation here at your [PLACE] is of dire importance, and attempts to contact you as we have previously have failed. I believe it is due to the very source of our concern. This object...

"We did have a bit of a... break-in. But we still have plenty to sell. [ENEMY] were only after one thing. An [ITEM], solid [ITEM]. In the shape of a [ENEMY]'s [ITEM]. I've got some [NUMBER] coming in from my last shipment. It's yours if you <SOA>bring my [ITEM] back<EOA>. <SOA>If you're going after those [ENEMY], you should head to [PLACE]<EOA>, northeast of town."
"I am [CHARACTER], the Gardener of Men, knower of the unknown, master of fates. You stand in my realm, mortal. You have sought out the forbidden knowledge that only one other has obtained. You are a seeker of knowledge and power, like [CHARACTER] before you. The [PLACE] have withheld their secrets from me for many long years. The time has come for this knowledge to be added to my library. <SOA>Convince them to give up their secrets<EOA>. My word is as true as fate, as inevitable as destiny. Bring me what I want, and I will give you what you seek."
