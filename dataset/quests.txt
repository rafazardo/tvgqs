"You know the <ENEMY> pit we discovered the other day that everyone's been talking about? <SOA>Kill the beast with one of your fireballs from the top<EOA>, <SOA>climb down<EOA>, and <SOA>bring back his head<EOA>. That should prove once and for all that you deserve to be the number two man. Good luck and be careful, you know how slippery it is up there."
"Take this fork, and use it to <SOA>kill two special <ENEMY> in single combat<EOA>. Each will yield an artifact: The <ITEM> of <CHARACTER>, and the <ITEM> of the <PLACE>.

If you're successful, you'll be rewarded quite handsomely, with the <ITEM>. If not, well... I do love to watch a good fight!"
"I'm surrounded by cowards. We were robbed by a group of <ENEMY>, they took all they could and killed most of those who tried to stop them. I did what I could, but if everybody helped we would've overpowered them easily. Hero, please <SOA>retrieve our <ITEM><EOA> and <SOA>get rid of those vermin<EOA>. I'll be coming along with you, at least, as long as you don't mind."
"As you can see these lands have been corrupted. For the longest time we didn't know what caused it, but now we do. It's the vile magic used by those wicked beings at the foot of the mountains. <CHARACTER>, please go there and <SOA>kill them before they taint everything<SOA>, <SOA>get rid of those hideous <ENEMY><SOA>."
"My brother is such an idiot, he keeps pulling pranks on me and I'm sick and tired of it. It's time for payback and I know the perfect way to do it. My brother is scared of forest spirits, they're not real, but I'm going to make him believe they are. I've made this wooden mask, but I need some more items to make it really scary. <SOA>Would you mind bring some for me? I need <ITEM>, some <ITEM> to make the eyes glow and a whole lot of <ITEM><EOA>."
"I'm afraid my ship's crew is made up of a bunch of fools. They managed to drop a whole load of cannonballs into the waters below. I really need those balls back, <SOA>would you mind gathering them for me?<EOA> Don't worry, they're not that heavy, you won't drown. I think."
"I'm running out of <ITEM>, but I won't be able to gather more. The thing is, I'm afraid of bugs and other creepy crawlies. Unfortunately, they create what I need. <ITEM> makes a great gauze and <ITEM> is a great disinfectant. What's even better is they're both natural and free! If only they weren't made by those creepy, tiny creatures. Please, <SOA>bring <ITEM> and <ITEM> for me<EOA> so I can continue my job."
"<CHARACTER> has fallen ill, he won't wake up no matter what I do. I believe we need to make him drink tea brewed from <ITEM>, but they only grow higher up the mountain and I cannot leave <CHARACTER>'s side. Please, hero, <SOA>get a handful <ITEM> as quick as you can<EOA>."
"Ah, greetings, <CHARACTER>. I am in desperate need of your help. A precious <ITEM> of my family has been stolen. Rumor has it that the notorious <ENEMY> in the <PLACE> is behind this misfortune. Please, <SOA>get it<EOA> and <SOA>bring it back to me<EOA>."

"Hail, <CHARACTER>. A powerful relic, an enchanted amulet, has been stolen by a band of <NUMBER> mischievous imps. Get rid of them down in the <PLACE>, <SOA>bring back the amulet<EOA>, and beware their tricks. The amulet holds a magic that can balance the light and darkness."

"<CHARACTER>, I need your help. My precious <ITEM> has been stolen. The cause of this misfortune is the famous <ENEMY> in <PLACE>. <SOA>Could you take it and give it back to me?<EOA>"
"<CHRACTER>, I feel mysterious being in <PLACE>. The once peaceful forest now has a dark curse. <SOA>Break the curse<EOA>."
"Imagine beautiful <ITEM>, made from the <ITEM> of <ENEMY> and <ENEMY>. Never before have I forged such <ITEM>, because nobody has been skilled enough to bring down the beasts. Could you be the first? Kill the beasts, <SOA>bring me their <ITEM> and <ITEM><EOA>, and I'll craft the best <ITEM> found on <PLACE> or anywhere else."
"They're burning down everything! Everything.. everything is turning to ashes.. My family.. they even... <CHARACTER>, I need you to avenge my family and get rid of those hideous <ENEMY>. It'll be dangerous, but I'm willing to come along if you need me to. Please, <SOA>take care of those <ENEMY><EOA>. <SOA>Try to kill all those who stand in your way<EOA>, we don't need their filth in our lands."
"Excuse me, <CHARACTER>. Help out a person in need. I need more antlers, a whole lot more. You see, I use antlers in all of my decorating and I just build a new addition to my house, so I will have to do a whole lot of decorating. There are plenty of deer in the forests around us, please <SOA>gather their antlers for me<EOA>. The deer meat will fill up my stocks nicely as well, wouldn't want to waste anything now, would we. Fortunately I have enough left to reward you well if you decide to help me."
"Forgive me, <CHARACTER>. I'm in need of your assistance. Eye for an eye! Blood for blood! If they wish to play dirty, so will we. <CHARACTER>, you've seen what they've done to our lands, it's time to unleash our vengeance upon those <ENEMY>. It'll be dangerous, but I'm willing to come along if you need me to. Be warry <CHARACTER>, they're stronger than they look those <ENEMY>. You can kill as many of them as you wish, <SOA>destroy all of them if you want<EOA>, curse those lowlives. I had hoped I'd be able to reward you handsomely, but unfortunately I don't have a lot left. I know you'll succeed, but do be careful."
"Please, <CHARACTER>. I need a favor of you. Oh I'm such a fool! I decided to play hide and seek with the <CHARACTER>, but my eyes aren't what they used to be and those kids are too good at hiding. I can't find them anywhere. Please, <SOA>help me find them<EOA>, I don't want anything bad to happen to them. Unfortunately there's not much I have to reward you with, but I think there's a few bits and pieces laying around."
Excuse me, <CHARACTER>. I need your help. Justice demands retribution! In this case it requires death! <CHARACTER>, a group of <NUMBER> <ENEMY> killed some of our farmers without mercy. We will not let them go unpunished. <CHARACTER>, be so kind and <SOA>deal with those beastly <ENEMY><EOA>. It'll be dangerous, but I'm willing to come along if you need me to.
Tread carefully <CHARACTER>, only a fool would underestimate the <ENEMY>. Killing them all won't be needed of course, I'm sure your skills will do enough damage to them. There's no big reward at the end of the line, but I think my reward will be more than fair. Now hurry, <CHARACTER>, there's no time to waste.
Forgive me, <CHARACTER>. Hear me out for a minute. I love the feeling of moss beneath my feet, it's probably the greatest feeling ever. Now, I've come up with a plan which will cover the floors of my house in <PLACE>, so I can always experience the greatest feeling ever. The best <ITEM> grows in <PLACE>, but I'm too scared to go in there and get the <ITEM> myself. It's so dark and creepy in there. <SOA>Could you gather the <ITEM> for me?<EOA> I will do my best to give you a suitable reward, but I can't promise it will be amazing.
You there, <CHARACTER>. You've come at the right time. Things have been too quiet lately, far too quiet. Our scouts report many <ENEMY> have set up camp on the borders of our lands, war is surely upon us. We need you to disrupt their activities, slow them down while we gather more forces. <SOA>Do anything you can to halt those filthy <ENEMY><EOA>. I won't be able to join you, but I have full confidence in you. I know you'll succeed.
Please excuse me, <CHARACTER>. I need a favor of you. We're completely overwhelmed. The war is at its peak and more and more injured come into our hospital in search of aid, but we're running low in supplies. None of us can afford to leave the injured to seek out more supplies, so we need you to do so. Please <SOA>gather <ITEM>, <ITEM>, <ITEM> and <ITEM><EOA>. I wish I had something better to reward you with, but what I have ain't too bad either.
Pardon me, traveler. Please, lend me your hand. I don't think I can control my fury any longer, <CHARACTER>. My wife, they killed her, <CHARACTER>. Please, you've got to help me. Retribution and vengeance are necessary, please <SOA>unleash it upon those cruel <ENEMY><EOA>. I cannot join you, for I have other tasks to attend to, but I know you don't need me anyway.
Tread carefully <CHARACTER>, only a fool would underestimate the <ENEMY>. I'm not asking you to <SOA>kill all of them<EOA>, just make sure you do what I ask of you. I'm afraid there's not much left I can reward you with, but I think I can still make it worth your troubles. I hope you return swiftly hero, we believe in you.
"I don't know where else to turn. My little boy was playing in that abandoned <PLACE> to the northwest when a pack of <ENEMY>s surrounded it. Please just <SOA>turn them back<AOA>, and I can coax him down. There's not much time! I can pay you <NUMBER> coins: this money is all my husband brought back from market this past week. My son's life is worth this and so much more."
"Perhaps... perhaps you are the type of people who can help me. I am in need of someone to... perform a service for me. I need someone... removed. This scoundrel is no innocent! He threatens to ruin my life with... with the spreading of... accusations. He threatens to ruin my reputation and standing unless I pay him an exorbitant sum almost weekly! I beg of thee... you must help me. His name is <CHARACTER> and he frequents the <PLACE> Tavern. I have not been there myself, but I hear it is quite a rough place. You could do the deed in the main bar itself and likely none would call the guards. I know not if he will have friends with him though. Thank you for this. Upon your return I shall pay you <NUMBER> gold. A small price to have this embarrassment removed."
"Hi! I'm <CHARACTER>. 'Scuse me. I ever so sowwy to bother, but <SOA>could you help me?<EOA> I've lost my little dog Rufie and I can't find him. He's probably ever so scared wight now. Poor Rufie isn't used to strange places an' people. You're sure to know him when you see him, 'cuz he's just the cutest little thing. Here, take this as well. His favorite chew toy, it is. He'll know you're a friend if you have it in your hands. I have a small reward for you: it's another of his chew things, but we can get more where we're going."
"The name's <CHARACTER>. I've got a dirty deed fer ya. How 'bout you go down into the sewers and bring me up a body. Now, I don't ask questions 'bout how you come 'bout them and I don't want any questions 'bout what I use 'em fer. <SOA>Bring 'em to me when ya find 'em<EOA>. There'll be <NUMBER> gold pieces to relieve the stink of it all."
"I am <CHARACTER>, though I thank you not to mention that too often. A local wizard by the name of <CHARACTER> makes his home in a moored Halruaan skyship. It would appear that he has the knowledge to reproduce these flying marvels and is currently organizing the sale of the recipe to Grand Duchess Liia Jannath. He has drawn up a set of rituals and has procured an <ITEM> fragment and an ancient statuette vital to the spell that keeps the ships aloft. These he has divided amongst his daughters until the deal is to proceed. I have been contacted by a representative of the Halruaans, and they have no wish to see scores of flying ships manufactured in every port. You are to infiltrate the <PLACE> of exchange that is known as Oberan's Estate, steal the ingredients, and return here with them. Simple enough. You would be well paid. Enough gold to give you a backache and, if I am well pleased, mayhaps a magical <ITEM> or two. Perhaps a little more, perhaps a little less. It entirely depends upon your performance."
"Mmm, be a sweet one. Could you do a favor for <CHARACTER>? An old lover of mine has followed me here to the <PLACE> and has been threatening me with some very dark magic. His name is <CHARACTER> and, <SOA>if you could just get a certain <ITEM> of his to me<EOA>, perhaps there are a few things I could do for you? Such as giving you a Scroll of Vampiric Touch, mmn?"
"Ah, fair adventurers, I'm <CHARACTER>. The roads of this fair <PLACE> are lined with fools, are they not? Two of the greatest are <CHARACTER> and <CHARACTER>, necromancers grown bitter over lost love. Alas, but they use petty trinkets as their excuse for enmity. <CHARACTER> covets <CHARACTER>'s <ITEM> and <CHARACTER> dreams of her <ITEM>. <SOA>Steal those trinkets<EOA> and <SOA>bring them to me<AOA> and perhaps those two fools can at last find peace. For your troubles I will give you a Cloak of Non-Detection. It may be of some use to you in the future."
"I'm <CHARACTER>, a very happy man. I've got to admit, I ain't never been happier. Got a letter from my lady and she's gonna be home reeeal soon... Just gotta find me a pretty little <ITEM> for her pretty little finger and all's gonna be just fine, just fine. But my lady, she transcends gold or silver or fancy stones. She'll have nothing less than an <ITEM> from me. For reward, if you're ever needin' a little work around here, check with Scar, second-in-command of the city guard. You can tell him I recommended you."
"Hey, I'm <CHARACTER>, an aspiring writer. Have you heard? There's a rogue <ENEMY> with a belt fetish to the south of the Friendly Arm Inn. I had to bargain my new <ITEM> of piercing for my life out there. Wasn't even interested in an autographed copy of my book. Hey, <SOA>if you can get that <ITEM> back to me<EOA>, I'd be mighty grateful. You'll get <NUMBER> gold pieces for your trouble, and a new history book I've just completed."
"I'm <CHARACTER>, a merchant by trade. I sell the small and shinies for the tourists in the <PLACE>'s Tower but there are none now there! Bandits on the roads keep the people off and away so I'm stuck with all this stock I am. Ward tokens I have of all shapes and size. Some I found by elven ruin and some I made myself I made. Maybe some good or maybe all bad but don't they all look pretty? I tell you what I will. I'll sell you everything I have you buy for low low price of <NUMBER> gold is all. Then I go home where they appreciate a bauble shine. Buy or no and walk the walk?"
"This whole thing is dirty to the core, that's what I know! These aren't your ordinary bandits here. <CHARACTER>'s been making regular visits to the <PLACE>, so that's where I'd start if I were you. There are some documents in that <ITEM> that might be worth taking a look at, too. Now go step on some toes, all right? And you can tell them Ender Sai sent you."
"Hey kid, it's me, <CHARACTER>. I need a quarrel of crossbow bolts. If you could get some off Winthrop at the <PLACE>, I'll reimburse you. there'll be a <ITEM> in it for you too. My father killed a <ENEMY> with it once, many years ago. Stabbed him right in the back, he did. It ain't no broadsword, but it'll do in a pinch."
"I'm <CHARACTER>, a ranger. You've come here to fight <ENEMY>? Well, listen up: it's mating season, so it's primarily females coming up to the surface, looking to put on a little extra weight. They're hungry, they're aggressive, and there are a lot of them. Now, the point of this exercise is not to exterminate them, but to keep their population to a manageable level. Remember, they aerate the soil and thereby improve crop yields by as much as <NUMBER>%. Food is going to be scarce enough in the next few years, so keep that in mind when you're out there. No more than four ankhegs per party. After that it's catch and release, all right? Most of the activity starts about fifty yards to the east. Now move out, everyone. You'll get <NUMBER> gold pieces, if you stick to the quota."
"Hey, you! Are you either bored or foolish? Either way, I, <CHARACTER>, could use your services. Some wiseacre tried to send a basilisk by freight and now it's broken free and is making a mess of one of the warehouses at the <PLACE>. There'll be <NUMBER> gold pieces for taking care of that on such short notice. Also, you might want these. They're an <ITEM> I obtained from a fence I know in a far-away <PLACE>. You never know, they might fit you."
"A warning from <CHARACTER>: know that there is a madman by the name of Bassilus who roams the wilderness killing any innocents that happen along his path. He's been last sighted in <PLACE>. If you were to dispose of him and <SOA>bring back his <ITEM><EOA>, there is a large reward offered. It is a grisly task, but sometimes there is little choice."
"Come one, come all! <CHARACTER>'s got something to show you! Take a look at the stone warrior maiden. How long has she been trapped in this petrified form, no one knows! Be the first to learn, for the mere price of <NUMBER> gold. For that small amount of money, I shall give you a magic scroll, and with this scroll you can release the maiden from her stone prison. Think of the gratitude she would feel to her saviors. Perhaps she's a princess from some far-off <PLACE>, or maybe a powerful sorceress in search of a concubine. You can't afford not to know! Buy the scroll!"
"Travelers! I am <CHARACTER>, a mage of minor power. I'll pay you <NUMBER> gold, not much for heroic adventurers, but all that I have. An <ENEMY> has laid a curse upon my only child, <CHARACTER>. She is slowly wasting away and, without help, she'll die. The mage who did this is named Yago, and I'm sure that he possesses the remedy to the curse. <SOA>Would you track him down for me, please?<EOA> He's been staying at a <PLACE> called the Low Lantern. It's the playground for the wicked and depraved, a ship where prostitutes ply their trade. All I want you to do is find him and take his spellbook. I have enough magical skill to reverse the curse if I had the formula for his spell."
"What cruel whim of the fates controls this torment of me?! I, Mr. <CHARACTER>, have heard nothing from my <CHARACTER> and his wife for nigh unto a week now, and all else pales in importance until I do. I should have known better than to allow his travel in these dangerous times."
"Pleasure to meet you. The name's <CHARACTER>. I'm from down south, where the Cloud Peaks tumble into the sea. A pair of <ENEMY> has been trying to move into the area. They sank my fishing boat and put me right out of work. sigh If they weren't so dang beautiful, it would be a lot easier to convince people of how much of a nuisance they can be. <SOA>Can you kill them for me?<EOA> It's a dirty deed but it's the cost of civilization, isn't it? You can have a <ITEM> as payment."
"Hi. I'm <CHARACTER>. Nice day, ain't it? Too bad <CHARACTER> here ain't enjoyin' it though, her bein' sick 'n all. I need to get her one of them <ITEM>. He stayed up drinkin' last night and got hauled outta bed to man the gates early this morning, so I bet he's got a few of them lyin' around somewheres."
"I'm just a little girl <CHARACTER>. Mommy says if you ever need to know something important, you should ask an adult. <CHARACTER>, my cat, she was playing close to the <PLACE> and slipped... I hope she's all right. You can have this scroll Daddy gave me, if you find <CHARACTER>. I can't read the words yet anyways."
"Please, kind spirits, a wondrous ancient oak is in peril. It is the tree to which I am bonded! If it dies, I, <CHARACTER> of the <PLACE>, die. It is about to be attacked by <NUMBER> who would defile the majesty of nature. They have avoided my charms and must be stopped before irreparable harm is done. <SOA>Would you heed my plea?<EOA> There is a <ITEM> that might help you on your journeys."
"Greetings, I'm <CHARACTER>. I hire mercenaries to escort caravans on route from <PLACE> to <PLACE>. Right now I'm lookin' for some strong sword arms, and I'm willing to pay high. It seems that one of the caravans under my protection never arrived at <PLACE>, and I need to know what happened. I've been having a lot of problems with <ENEMY> activity lately, but they've always only taken the cargo and let the caravan go afterward. <SOA>I'll pay each of you <NUMBER> gold per dead <ENEMY><EOA>, plus a share of any booty, if there's no one left alive to claim it."
"I am <CHARACTER>. A <ENEMY> has stolen my <ITEM>, wanderer, and fled eastward towards the <ENEMY>'s lair. The poor <ENEMY> is probably quite dead by now but the <ENEMY>s, of course, will not recognize the <ITEM>'s value. <SOA>If you could retrieve it for me,<EOA> I promise to brighten your karma.
"I beseech thee, kind soul, please help. I'm farmer <CHARACTER>. It's strange happenings at my <PLACE>, and I've not the strength I once had. I've nothing to offer, and even if I did I doubt such as you would have need of it. My son <CHARACTER> and his friends went looking for our missing cattle, then they just up and disappeared! Been gone for days now and, with all the bandits around, who knows what's happened. I don't know where they were heading, but I saw some sort o' tracks to the west. <SOA>Please find <CHARACTER><EOA>. I can't afford to keep the <PLACE> without my son."
"I, <CHARACTER>, have a small errand for you. I left an identify scroll with <CHARACTER>, in the inner grounds. He should be done examining it by now, so <SOA>if you could fetch it for me,<EOA> I'd be grateful. I have a great use for those types of scrolls. Allow me to cast a little spell on you as a reward. It will protect you from any evil you might meet tonight."
"For your own health and that of your children, come no closer. I, <CHARACTER>, was cursed with this fell disease as punishment for my wickedness... No, your <ITEM>s and magics are of little use. The only way to cure this sickness is to right the wrongs of the past. Behind a painting at the <PLACE>, you will find the skull of my brother, <CHARACTER>. <SOA>Take it to <CHARACTER> in the <PLACE><EOA>. She will know what to do with it."
"Old <CHARACTER> had his famous <ITEM> stolen right off his back by a batch of paltry <ENEMY>. Yeah, yeah, it's old news and if you make one crack about the <PLACE> being an appropriate place to lose it, at least, I'll put your liver on the menu. Now move on and let the next people in line have their laugh. However, <SOA>if you happen to find my <ITEM>, I'll give you <NUMBER> gold pieces for returning it<EOA>."
"I'm still healing from my latest encounters. They did quite a number on me, those <ENEMY>. There's a band of them fortifying themselves in the mountains south-southwest of here... <SOA>If you could give them a taste of justice by testing your steel against them, that would do me, <CHARACTER>, proud<EOA>. In an effort to encourage such deeds of righteousness, allow me to present to you this shield as a reward upon your return..."
"Hey, kid, it's me, <CHARACTER>. I woke late this morning and left my <ITEM> in the <PLACE> before going on duty. <SOA>If you want to get it for me,<EOA> it's in the chest at the foot of my bed on the right side of the <PLACE>. Quick now, before the Gatewarden catches me without it. You'll also find an <ITEM> there. I think Dreppin needs one for old Nessa. You'll get <NUMBER> gold pieces for saving my skin from the Chief."
"Oh, thank goodness someone came by. I'm <CHARACTER>. There's a <ENEMY> on the other side of that bridge, and it's coming this way! I can't run anymore! <SOA>Please hold it off<EOA> — I'll give you anything!"
"Hey there, you're new here, aren't you? Could I, <CHARACTER>, trouble you a moment? I need someone to go club some heads for me. I was ambushed by a band o' <ENEMY>s within sight of this <PLACE>'s walls. Robbed me blind, they did, and I want to return the favor. I don't care about most of my things, but I want to get my ring back. My father gave it to me, you understand? The <ENEMY>s were just north of the <PLACE>. <SOA>Bring my ring back here when you get it<EOA>. You'll know it when you see it. It's a Flamedance Ring, and very striking."
"My husband is missing in the mines. All I know about the mines are that men keep on disappearing in their hellish depths. My husband is one of the miners, but he hasn't been home for weeks. His name is <CHARACTER>, and he wears his wedding ring on his left hand. It's a <ITEM>. Please, <SOA>find him and tell me how he is doing!<EOA>"
"Are you going to be going down into the <PLACE>? If so, <SOA>could you return this <ITEM> to <CHARACTER>?<EOA> He dropped it when he went into the <PLACE> the other day and I haven't seen him since."
"Hi! I'm <CHARACTER>. That's my twin sister, <CHARACTER>. Mom and Dad don't believe us, but there's a <ENEMY> that comes and looks in our window every night. We're real glad we're twins because, if there were only one of us, then there'd be no one to hold on to when we get scared. <SOA>Scare away the <ENEMY>, would you?<EOA> Mom says to give this <ITEM> as a reward."
"Hey, I'm <CHARACTER>. I've got an infestation of poisonous spiders in my cellar in <PLACE>. You'll know the house when you see it: just to the west of the <PLACE> Inn. Here, take these <ITEM>s with you. They're antidotes against the poison. Keep whatever you don't use and <SOA>I'll give you an extra <NUMBER> gold pieces if you bring back my husband's old boots that he keeps down there<EOA>. If you <SOA>bring back one of their bodies and my ol' bottle of wine as well<EOA>, I might toss in a little something extra too."
"I am <CHARACTER>. I do not wish you harm. My partner, <CHARACTER>, has poisoned you. While you slept, he slipped a slow-acting magical poison into your food. You have about ten days to live. Common priest spells won't help you. Only one thing can, and that's the antidote. I can help you find it, if you help me first. My problem is this: I don't work for the Iron Throne because I wish to but rather because I have been forced. I have been enspelled with a geas. If I do not obey everything that <CHARACTER> orders of me the spell will take effect and I shall waste away. I need a way to rid myself of the spell. I know of a diviner at the market square who may have the answers I seek, but I don't have the money to pay him. <SOA>Will you help me?<EOA>"
"I'm <CHARACTER>. I just had some new <ITEM> shipped in from a far-away <PLACE> and I'm afraid I must have dropped the gauntlets into one of the shipping crates somewhere between here and the harbor. Please,<SOA> if you can find them before somebody else picks them up<EOA>, I would be most grateful."
"I, <CHARACTER>, desperately need someone's help. <CHARACTER>, my youngest <CHARACTER>, has run away again... He's always had a touch of the wanderer in him and he knows how to take care of himself, but... Oh, I'm just worried sick. This <PLACE> gets more dangerous every day... If you find him, <SOA>could you give him this good luck talisman?<EOA> I'm sure we'd all sleep a little better. Let me give you this <ITEM> as a token of my thanks upon your return. I don't know if it's worth anything but it has been in the family for years."
"Hmph. I am <CHARACTER> and I don't like you. I bet you're another one of those adventurers wantin' to change the world or somethin'. Well, go pick on the <ENEMY>s to the south if it will make you feel better. <SOA>Go find someone else to talk to<EOA>, I'm no good at this quest stuff. I have... ummm... people to see and <PLACE>s to be."
"Hullo. The name's <CHARACTER>. There's a <ENEMY> 'oled up in the hills due west of 'ere, close to the High Hedge. Damn thievin' ball-o-fur stole my short sword two days back. The sword ain't worth the tin she's made from. <SOA>I'll give ya <NUMBER> gold pieces just to seal that<EOA> yappin' mouth of 'is for good."
"Hi, I'm <CHARACTER> and my folks aren't around no more and I ran away from my Uncle <CHARACTER> 'cause he's real mean. My cat's really an angel, though, and she protects me when bad things happen. Or at least she did. I can't find her now, though. I think she went back to my uncle's to get her <ITEM>. There's this <ITEM> that she loves to play with, but when I ran away I had to leave it at my nasty uncle's. If you could just get me the <ITEM>, I'm sure Angel would come back. <SOA>Could you do it, oh please?<EOA>"
"It's me, <CHARACTER>. A bit of nonsense from a local artist named Prism. Made off with a couple of emeralds, he did. There is a reward for the return of the gems: a <NUMBER> gold bounty. Prism's fate is of less importance."
"I'm <CHARACTER>. There's some <ENEMY>s causin' chaos upriver, alon' the east bank, just north o' that bitch priestess. They took down my pal, <CHARACTER>, and dang near hauled me under too. 'At's why I'm so glum now. <CHARACTER>'s mama's gonna want somepin' of 'is to bury, but I'm still gettin' too many nightmares and all to go back there."
"I thought I asked you to clean the rats out of this building yesterday, already. Hop to it! Get in there! Ah yes, <SOA>kill them like the rats that they are!<EOA> A glorious battle unlike any this world has ever seen... I'll give you <NUMBER> gp, don't spend it all in one place."
"Greetings, we are <CHARACTER> and Boo. Boo is my faithful hamster companion, and more than he seems. We have traveled far to explore this land, but now my charge Dynaheir has been taken from us. 'Twas <ENEMY>s, and once we have tracked them I will beat sense into their heads until they release her. Accompany us, and bards will sing the deeds of <CHARACTER> and Boo... and friends. Onward to the <ENEMY> stronghold in the west!"
"I am <CHARACTER>, mage and recent convert to the Church of Selûne. I was the guide for Balduran's brave adventures to the ends of the world and beyond. The <ENEMY>-men are everywhere. The lycanthropes' lair is in Balduran's ship. My <ITEM> lies within. With it, I am a powerful mage. Without it, I am the pauper that stands before you. With my <ITEM> retrieved, I may be able to discover a way off of the island. If you go to destroy the lycanthropes' lair, <SOA>I would ask that you find my <ITEM><EOA>."
"My name is <CHARACTER> and I can make you richer than you could imagine. I know where the <CHARACTER> dumped his greatest trove of treasure. Knowing that you are a dynamic and intelligent person, I know you'd want to join me in a venture to get this treasure. Well, we should be off then. From what my map showed, the pirate cove is located somewhere along the coast, just south of <PLACE>."
"Please wait a moment, kind traveler! You've got to help me! My name is <CHARACTER>. You must forgive me for my appearance, but I've been wandering the wilderness for more than a week now. My friend is badly hurt, and he might die if he doesn't get assistance soon. His name is <CHARACTER>. If you were to take him to <CHARACTER> at the <PLACE>, she'd help him. <SOA>Please, can you do this?<EOA>"
"I am a proud member of the <PLACE>. I've been searching for a deserter. His name is <CHARACTER>, and he should be traveling with a woman. <SOA>There is a bounty of <NUMBER> gold for his capture<EOA>."
"Hmm, I am <CHARACTER> and I prefer not to work with amateurs. There's a fat man by the name of <CHARACTER> staying at <PLACE>'s Inn in <PLACE>. He keeps a cloak with him in his room and I need you to get your larcenous hands on it and <SOA>bring it back to me<EOA>. I assure you that your reward will be handsome. <SOA>Try not to kill him<EOA>, just filch it off his person."
"You may call me <CHARACTER>. <ENEMY>! Oh, he makes me seethe! He's a mage on a power trip and what does he do? He acquires his own personal nymph and enslaves her in his quarters! <SOA>Seek him out and look into this matter immediately!<EOA> His house is in the northwest part of <PLACE>. I wish you luck and all the passion of my fury in your task."
"Greetings to you and yours, my friend. I'm <CHARACTER>. Might I have your ear a moment? My proposition is thus: <SOA>I would have you enter into the home of a colleague of mine and effect the release of a creature he has imprisoned there<EOA>. <ENEMY> be his name, and he has in his possession one of the most beautiful and useful creatures in all of Faerûn. It's a nymph he captured some time ago, and I know not what laughable plans he has for her, but I am sure she be more... productive in my care. I not so rich as to be able to offer huge gold, but as competent wizard I do have the odd magical <ITEM> of worth. Perhaps an enchanted <ITEM> will serve your needs, no?"
"Well met, traveler. <CHARACTER> Luckyfoot, at your disposal. If I might pull on your coattail a moment more, I have a proposition for you. It's usually nature-quiet by the Firewine ruins, even with its violent bygone. Those who died and did not sleep have mostly found their rest over time. It's a live threat that comes now, with a band of <ENEMY>s that moved in. Perhaps we could prevail upon you to rid us of this menace, and in return, a gift from us you shall receive. Keep whatever you find as well."
"We're being harassed by a Priestess of the Bitch Queen <ENEMY>. We don't even know why, but whenever we attempt to fish she turns the weather sour. Two of us were washed away just walking to the docks, but we cannot prove to the guard it was her. We be needin' someone to strong-arm her into leaving us alone. We've not much money, but I'll gladly give you a... magical <ITEM> from my grandfather's adventuring days. It's a meager amount for your trouble, but it would be a great service to us. Will you help a group of poor fishermen? She hides out near a small shack to the north. <SOA>Watch yer back and act quickly<EOA>; she's tricky."
"I am called <CHARACTER>. I am a traveling paladin. Ah, travelers, this wilderness is too expansive to keep clear of <ENEMY>s all on my own. Many gibberlings pass through this very spot day and night. <SOA>Will you stay here and help fend them off?<EOA> Fire magics work well against the gibberlings, so if you have such spells, use them."
"First off, let me introduce myself. I'm <CHARACTER>, second-in-command of the <PLACE>. I need you to begin an investigation of the <PALCE> trading coster. The Seven Suns leadership has been acting strangely of late. They've been selling off valuable assets and neglecting many of their more profitable trading ventures. Considering the importance that the trading coster holds over the economy of the city, the Grand Dukes are noticeably upset. I've gone to talk to the coster's head, <CHARACTER>. He rudely rebuffed me, telling me to mind my own business. I've known <CHARACTER> for many years, and this isn't his usual behavior. I can't start up an official investigation, as there is no real reason for doing so. That's why I need you. I want you to break into the Seven Suns compound and find out what's wrong. <SOA>Use stealth in your investigations<EOA>; I don't want this operation to cause too much fuss. <SOA> most important person to watch for is <CHARACTER><EOA>. Once you've found out as much as possible, <SOA>report back to me at the <PLACE><EOA>. I'll pay you <NUMBER> gold for this favor."
"Hail, adventurers. I'm <CHARACTER>, and I work for <CHARACTER> Rosena. She's the most skilled musician and actor along the Sword Coast. I have a proposal for you. How would you like a well-paying job as a bodyguard for my mistress? She's been having some problems of late. Some thugs have been hired by <CHARACTER> to hurt her bad because she didn't perform at his inn when she was supposed to. You can't blame her for not showing up, what with a villain like <CHARACTER> running the place. Just meet me outside of the Red Sheaf Inn, if you are interested in the job."
"I am <CHARACTER> Ghastkill, mayor of <PLACE>. I need someone to descend into the mines southeast of town and find what has caused our miners to go missing and our ore to become tainted. It won't solve everything, but it's the first step to easing the effects of the iron shortage. The town can give you a reward of <NUMBER> gold pieces. We are a small community and that is all we can afford. Please, go now and do what you can."
"Greetings to you. I am <CHARACTER>, a humble servant of Our Smiling Lady <CHARACTER>. My request of you is an odd and very dangerous one. I will not hold you to it if you deem it too extreme. I would have you enter the <PLACE> and retrieve my son's, <CHARACTER>'s, body. <CHARACTER>sought to indulge his restless nature by sneaking about the <PLACE>, and a high price was paid. <SOA>You must bring <CHARACTER>'s body to me<EOA>, that I may restore his life to him."
"I am <CHARACTER> and, to be honest, I could use your help. The <ENEMY> raids have been getting worse. I used to think that they were just your usual brigands out to make a quick buck in troubled times, but not anymore. They're working for someone... Damn it, this is a fine mess, isn't it? <SOA>I'll pay <NUMBER> gold pieces for every <ENEMY> <ITEM> you can bring me<EOA> — and spread the news. I want this whole region cleared, and I want to know what in the Nine Hells is going on here."
"I am but a humble merchant. Interested in a little business on the side, friend? I've a man who swears by his grandmother he glimpsed a white <ENEMY> up in the Cloudpeak ice fields. It was but a short ways south, and she be easy pickings for a smart sword. <SOA>I'd pay you good money for its <ITEM><EOA>, so it's a guaranteed sale if you go. Keep it in mind on your travels."
"I'm Hulrik! You have to help me! The <ENEMY> are after my cows again! Ever since the <ENEMY> an' their <ENEMY> swarmed the mines at <PALCE>, they've been makin' attacks like that more and more often."
"Hey, I'm <CHARACTER>! What is a thief to do, huh? You invest in some Boots of Stealth, you set up shop in the badlands to the south of Beregost and then, WHAM... Along comes a tribe of <ENEMY> and they tear the boots from right off your feet! Damn-blasted <ENEMY> bullies... I'll pay you <NUMBER> gold pieces to show them who's boss and get those boots back..."
"I be <CHARACTER>, a farmer by profession. There's been something killing peoples in and 'round the farms here. <ENEMY> or something. I can understands if you can't stomach the task but, just between you an' me real personal-likes, I don't know who else is gonna do it... All of us haves been goin' for a week now without sleep. We've counted <NUMBER> <ENEMY> or so, so keep track as you <SOA>kill 'em<EOA>, if that's what you plans on doing. Once you got 'em all, come back here and I'll gives you the <NUMBER> gold pieces that some of us have pooled together."
"SEE the horror of the treacherous traps! FEEL the presence of the long languishing dead! MARVEL at the wondrous wealth buried below! NOT for the weak of spirit as I will NOT be held accountable for any heart failure during OR after our expedition! Step up, step up! One at a TIME! A special package deal of <NUMBER> gold for you, not that you would need a discount."
"In <PLACE>, there is building in northeast section of city called <PLACE>. To find it, just go northeast from <PLACE>. The sea charts, they are in there. Most likely, captain of ship will have them. I don't know such things as chart retrieval, but you are hero, and it is no problem for heroes. There might be small danger, so I give you some gold for the charts."
"My name is <CHARACTER>and I am pleasured to meet ye. I seek the return of an <ITEM>, more an icon. No doubt you felt the storm that passed just by and by? Village-home did as well, and the cloak that draped the village center was cast to the wind. I think it is beyond the wall, and will not risk the <ENEMY> to get it. Will you? I can offer little besides my gratitude. The cloak is a keepsake, a symbol of old times."
"I am <CHARACTER>, and I am glad to be meeting. I have but a mundane task to ask of you, if you hear me out? The storm you felt that took your ship? It was fierce here too, and a cloak that draped the <PLACE> center was cast to the wind. I think it is beyond the wall, and will not risk the <ENEMY> to get it. Will you?
"I am <CHARACTER>, I fish for clan in these savage waters. Listen, outsider, may I ask you for help? There is a witch on this <PLACE>. My brother called her the Blue Lady and those of us who ply these waters have all heard her singing at one time or another. My brother, <CHARACTER>, heard her more than most. I think that he went to find her. I think that he is under her spell. I must go and find him. This witch might kill him. He is strong but he is under her spell. I fear that she will kill him before he realizes what is happening. <SOA>Can you find my brother?<EOA> I don't know exactly where the Blue Lady is. I have the sense to avoid her, unlike <CHARACTER>. But I have only heard her singing along the west coast of the <PLACE>."
"My name's <CHARACTER>. I'm only <NUMBER>. In a few years my papa will let me hunt. Are you allowed to hunt? I've lost my dolly out in the woods. The gatekeeper won't let me go and get it. <SOA>Can you get it for me?<EOA>"
"I'm <CHARACTER>. Hey, how'd you like to be supping on fine venison and tippin' back the good stuff? I've the key to wealth legendary if you're up for it. No doubt you've heard of the labyrinth at <PLACE>'s Tower, eh? And how she's been pillaged so often that fat nobles go there for picnics? Well, the TOWER has, but BELOW are dungeons untouched! I've a token, a ward token to be sure, that gives entry to them. 'Tis yours if you'll but settle my tab so I can leave this fine <PLACE>... with all my limbs intact."
"Oh, please help me! I'm <CHARACTER>. They kill poor <CHARACTER>. The wolf-men. They attack us as we search for roots in the forest. Please avenge my <CHARACTER>. He was so young... They are this way. <SOA>Please kill them<EOA>, I am so frightened."
"Hello, good people. I am <CHARACTER>. Two moons ago my husband took my son out hunting with him. They were attacked by those horrible wolf-creatures. They... they killed my husband and took my baby. Others say that they took the baby away to eat him, but I know he's still alive. He's a beautiful little boy with dark hair like his father. He is <NUMBER> moons old and his name is <CHARACTER>. They took him from my husband northeast of the <PLACE>, in the woods."
"Good day to you, stranger. I'm called <CHARACTER>. Excuse my, uhm, abruptness but I would ask your assistance. Just east of this <PLACE> there are <ENEMY>. They are attacking a small group of people. Please, <SOA>if you have hearts, come and help me fight<EOA>."
"Ohoy, I'm Captain <CHARACTER> Kieres. A jug o' this town's hardest liquor would make for a fine departure, if ye'd be so kind. Old De'Tranion brews a vile swill at'll do the trick. Ye can find the old coot at the <PLACE>."
"Greetings, adventurer. I have, or perhaps I should say had, a son named <CHARACTER>. He fell in with a crew of adventurers from <PLACE>. <CHARACTER> was always obsessed with the idea of being a hero. Alas, he has neither the brains nor the ability. Such is a mother's lot in life, however, to watch her children perform acts of idiocy despite her warnings or concerns. He and his thick-skulled cohorts took it upon themselves to plumb the depths of <PLACE>'s Tower. They bought a ward token from that shyster, <CHARACTER>, and made ready to leave. Though I begged and cried, <CHARACTER> still insisted on going. The band never returned. I fear that they were destroyed by the mad dwarf's machinations. That is the tale, sad but true. Please <SOA>find my son<EOA> if he still lives."
"<ENEMY>! All I know is they killed <CHARACTER> when she tried to talk to them, and I can't face them by myself. At first they appeared around the house of an old mage, but soon they moved into a set of caves to the northeast, taking him with them. Forgive me. My name is <CHARACTER>. <CHARACTER> and I have watched over this area for years, and we never had any trouble with <ENEMY> before. Since they killed her, I've been half out of my mind with grief. Please <SOA>avenge my <CHARACTER><EOA> and give her a proper burial!"
"Hold, traveler! I, <CHARACTER>, <SOA>challenge your best warrior to a duel<EOA>. I don't fight women, so only men should step forward. I win, and you give me <NUMBER> gold.
"Hello there, I'm <CHARACTER>, a blacksmith of some renown. An interesting piece o' material you got there. <ENEMY>, if I'm not mistaken. Been a while since I seen the like, but if I remember correctly, it makes a fine set of <ITEM>. If properly treated it's comparable to full plate with half the weight! If you're willing to part with your shells I'll give you <NUMBER> gold for the lot of them. No more can I offer with business as slow as it is. Iron shortage hurting us all."
"Stop! You have trespassed on our territory. You shall not be allowed to leave until you have paid tribute. We demand <NUMBER> gold in tribute! No money? That is too bad for you. We let you go only if you win fight. Your best champion versus our best champion. Our best champion is <CHARACTER>. <CHARACTER> is me. Are you ready for fight? No matter, <SOA>we fight now!<EOA> If you lose, you must die! If you win, we must let you pass! Tread carefully, we will be watching you."
"It is so pleasant to see your face once again. Don't you recognize me? It is I, <CHARACTER> Sashenstar. I am so glad to have met you, especially at a time like this. I need to speak with you privately. I'm sorry for all of this hiding and skulking, but there are dire events afoot. You know that I am one of the principal shareholders of the <PLACE>. Well, I share ownership of the company with two others: <CHARACTER> and <CHARACTER>"
"I, Talon Yarryl, priest of <CHARACTER>, have a mission for you! <CHARACTER> demands proper tribute, and that occasionally means artwork pleasing to the eye. If a piece of his fury can be represented, more might see and fear it. An artist visits <PLACE> now. The artist travels under the name Sir Sarles, though it is surely a fake. He is pretentious, demanding, and very good. We must command a commission from him. But he is not being cooperative. His commission is outlandish, and he demands illithium as his medium! He may as well have asked for dragon tears. <SOA>Convince him to work for <CHARACTER><EOA>."
"I am <CHARACTER>, a messenger sent by the <PLACE> to find someone to help our town. <PLACE> is under attack by <ENEMY>. The <PLACE> thinks <ENEMY> may be responsible, but we haven't the manpower to <SOA>find them and stop it<EOA>. The <PLACE> will have more information for you."
"I am <CHARACTER>, a warrior priest. I must discover the truth about <CHARACTER>'s murder. <SOA>We must head for <CHARACTER>'s home in the <PLACE>!<EOA>"
"My friend <CHARACTER> has been taken captive by those <ENEMY>. I would have you enter their building and find <CHARACTER> for me. Short... halfling... thief... even one of your intellectual capacity can't miss him. <SOA>Go to their building<EOA> and <SOA>return once you have found him<EOA>."
"I am <CHARACTER> and I have been bound by <CHARACTER> to guard his <ITEM>, and your <ITEM> it seems. I can sense your touch upon this <ITEM>. If you can secure the means of my release, I will give you your <ITEM>. I was captured in my home, on <PLACE>, by <ENEMY>. He bound me to this flask that I might guard his things. <SOA>You must find my <ITEM><EOA> and <SOA>bring it back to me<EOA>. Once it is within my grasp, I can break the enchantment and be freed."

"I am the spirit of the <PLACE>, child. I am the water, the earth, the trees, and the sun. I am life and death: the eternal cycle. A druid who serves the cause of balance is needed. The <PLACE> requires leadership, a gentle hand. Will you serve the <PLACE> as such? There is much work to be done. Listen and learn the path of balance, the path of the Eternal Cycle. Long have the <ENEMY>s of the mound lived beneath the protection of the <PLACE>. But a new leader has arisen. <CHARACTER> the shamaness leads the <ENEMY>s to chaos. She urges them to expand their territory, and she brings more <ENEMY>s to the mound without thought to the consequences. If this continues, the <ENEMY>s will overrun the <PLACE>, and nature will suffer. A servant of nature must bring the life cycle of <CHARACTER> to a close for the good of all. You will find <CHARACTER> along the path to the east of the <ENEMY> mound."
"It is I, the spirit of the <PLACE>, child. Child of nature, you are again needed. Balance is threatened, and Chaos is at the periphery. Will you serve the <PLACE>? The <PLACE> is young in terms of nature and ancient in the years of man. Centuries ago, <CHARACTER> of <PLACE> established a protectorate of nature in these woods. Now, as <CHARACTER> knew would someday happen, his descendants have returned and old <ENEMY>s marshal their forces. A child called <CHARACTER> has recently arrived in <PLACE>. This child is the inheritor of <CHARACTER>'s spirit, but does not yet have the knowledge to use his power. Surely he shall be slain by the forces of chaos if you do not rescue him. Even now he is alone and in danger, his parents slain by an evil that haunts him. You must <SOA>find the child <CHARACTER> in <PLACE><EOA> and <SOA>fight <CHARACTER>'s old <ENEMY>s to save the child's life<EOA>. The spirit that once was <CHARACTER> has gone forth to aid the child... but the spirit is not the power that the man once was and cannot hope to hold out for long. Aid him lest all be lost."
"We are the three <CHARACTER>. You must help us get free of this... creature <CHARACTER>! We are <CHARACTER>'s possessions, servants, and concubines. You must get our acorns back from <CHARACTER>, the clan leader of <CHARACTER>'s <ENEMY> slaves. He is somewhere within this <PLACE>. Please <SOA>take the acorns to the <CHARACTER> Queen who lives in the south end of the Windspear Hills<EOA>."
"Greetings. I am <CHARACTER>, cleric of <ITEM>. I would speak with you. I would hire you as a mercenary in the service of <ITEM>. I would prefer a person of faith, but you will be adequate. <SOA>Follow me to the temple of <ITEM><EOA>."
"I am <CHARACTER>, high priest of the One God. There is... something that you could do that the great one cannot, despite his vast power. The Unseeing Eye knows of a valuable <ITEM> in this area. The <ITEM> is a rod... or part of a rod, rather, that you will find atop a holy <PLACE>. I cannot tell you more than that. You must let your faith guide you. If you were to venture below, you could prove your worth by <SOA>retrieving this <ITEM> for him<EOA>. Do this, and I will allow you into our ranks and the One's divine presence. I have a key I can give you... This will allow you entrance to the inner chambers through a door a short distance back the way you came, at the sewer passages."
"Aha! I see a wayfarer has come to amuse <CHARACTER>! You must answer a riddle, naturally, ere I will allow you to pass this bridge. Here's the riddle, my friend: The poorest have it, the richest need it, but if either were to eat it, they would certainly perish. Tell me what it is!"
"M-my name is <CHARACTER>. I... work in the circus with my uncle, <CHARACTER>... I... I'm not a <ENEMY>! I'm an elf, a winged elf... or at least I was... This... this covering you see is some kind of illusion, but if you believe in it, then it becomes real! P-please believe me! Now go before something happens to you, I beg of you! If... if you're not going to flee, then maybe you can help free me from the chains that keep me bound in this form — and then maybe I can help you! You... you need the key to these chains. But... but it won't look like a key! There are a couple of... <CHARACTER>... in the north side of this chamber... Don't be fooled by the illusion, though... they are <ENEMY>! They have a sword which is actually my key... if you get it from them, I can remove the chain and regain my normal form! But please be careful! You... you can't trust anything you see here!"
"My name's <CHARACTER>. I was sent to f-find someone, but things have been gone all wrong! sniffle I've had all my money stolen, and I'm lost, and everyone's so mean. sniff I was sent to find someone who could h-help my village, <PLACE>. Terrible things are happening there, and nobody knows what to do! Everyone says they seen strange b-beasts out in the hills. Everyone's so frightened! There's even t-t-talk that Umar herself has returned! When you get to <PLACE>, talk to Minister <CHARACTER>! He can tell you everything else!"
"My name is <CHARACTER>. Something's wrong with my daughter. Her name is <CHARACTER>. She's hurt, traveler. I don't know what's wrong with her. She just lies in bed staring at the wall. Won't even eat. Please heal her. She's just a little girl. Please, you must go and find out exactly what <CHARACTER> knows about <CHARACTER>'s condition. <SOA>You'll find him in the <PLACE><EOA>."
"Hmmn. I don't remember seeing you down here before. Me name be <CHARACTER>. Oh, the sewers aren't so terrible. The guards don't be comin' down here, and my customers like to be somewhere... out of sight. 'Tis the beasties that are the biggest problem, especially of late. There's this sea troll. People have 'em as pets, and when they grow too large, they huck 'em down here to torment me. I suppose I could part with a few coins for the deed. I tell you what... <SOA>dispose of the <ENEMY> for me<EOA>, an' I'll be pleased to pay you <NUMBER> gold pieces, aye?"
"Come... follow me inside o' <PLACE>'s, and let's have a little talk wi' <CHARACTER>, aye? I do believe he is on the second floor. I be a poor, poor man, me pal... I have almost nothing to offer ye. <SOA>I beg ye to help<EOA> a destitute teacher find some justice!"
"I am <CHARACTER> Arenthis of the church of Lathander... excuse my young charge. <CHARACTER> doesn't talk much since the recent death of her parents. There is very little that can be done for her as well... other than to put her into an orphanage, I suppose. She is so shy and sad, though, I am sure it will do her no good. If only there were someone who would care for her. <SOA>Might you know of someone who would make a suitable guardian?<EOA>"
"Me <ENEMY>... lead fellows from great army of <ENEMY> in the south. No want to kill races no more. Lead fellows in desertion. We just wants be left alone. Always <ENEMY> and fellows be chased and hated 'cause me an ogre! We just wants to be left alone. We come here one moon ago, tries to settle for a while, yes? We needs you bring word to human village... humans run when <ENEMY> goes, so me needs youse to do it for me. Youse bring word, yes? <ENEMY> no want death... <ENEMY> no want fight. Just want peace. <SOA>You tell villagers, maybe, that <ENEMY> and fellows will protect village<EOA>... protect from orcs in mountains, yes? We have shield to give you... is magic, from <ENEMY>'s army... we no use. Maybe you like."
"I am <CHARACTER>, a Cowled Wizard, and I have been assigned to offer you... a special deal. You just recently took this sphere, and by all rights we should have it, but my superiors said to offer an alternative. It would seem we have need of you. That said, they would like to offer an exchange. You may operate in this awkwardly placed sphere if you agree to certain duties for the Cowled Wizards. It is simple: You may have this place and act freely as a wizard. In exchange,<SOA> you do the odd task for us, acting when we can't because of political or other reasons<EOA>."
"My daughter is gone! I left my home in your care! I... I... no, no, I know it was not you... I know who my <ENEMY> are. Damn that <CHARACTER>! What is his grief with me?! I don't know where you will find him. His hooligans prevent searching. I don't know... Perhaps the ruins in the northeast? I don't know... Please rescue my child, no matter the risk. You will travel unmolested, for my pleas of your virtue were heard at the Radiant Heart. They demand justice for the slain knights, so that is your task now. <SOA>Do this<EOA>, and your honor shall be restored."
"Greetings, Your Grace. I actually have a rather angry merchant by the name of <CHARACTER> Bendelia that has been demanding to see you. It might have something to do with his caravan being waylaid by <ENEMY> passing through the region, but he refuses to speak to anyone but Your Grace. He is an influential merchant in this area; I believe he owns the deed to more than one local farmhold. <SOA>Will you grant this man an audience, my liege?<EOA> I shall show him in."
"Greetings, my liege. It is I, <CHARACTER>, your captain of the guard. I am not sure if you have been aware, but we have been experiencing a number of thefts in the keep over the past couple of weeks. A goblet, some silverware, a few coins from the servants' quarters. All of these things have value, although none of them were major thefts. Still... I investigated. <CHARACTER> here is one of the new guards. I caught him red-handed, attempting to take a necklace that belonged to the late Lady de'Arnise. <CHARACTER> has confessed his crime. I am unsure how to punish him, my liege, so I have brought this before you. He is your subject, my liege, so yours is the right to decide punishment, but you are also... being watched carefully by those who oppose your rule, however."
"My name be <CHARACTER>, priest of <ITEM>, the god of battles! Hahr... it has been some time since I have rested my feet in any place, to tell the truth. I've been wandering for many a year now. The traveling does wear on me, to tell the truth. I've come to ask if you've a chapel that a priest of <ITEM> might set himself up in... bring the good Word to the folk of the area. What do you say, eh? If my manner does not strike you as offensive, I would be glad to be chaplain of your wee keep here. I can help your people here much while I stay. But I do not promise to stay for long. Either you accept me or you don't, my liege... that is your choice, and I'll not begrudge it you."
"I am <CHARACTER>, and I have been cursed. I am dead yet not dead. Cursed to eternal entrapment in this tomb by cruel <ENEMY>! Cursed to a fate worse than death! But the curse can be reversed! With your assistance, I may live again. I have suffered for so long... will you help me? The fiends that did this to me keep me from returning by tearing apart my mortal form and keeping the pieces separated. You must find my body that I might again take mortal form. The pieces are very close! I have no doubt that they lie within the <PLACE> in tombs such as this. My <ENEMY> are predictable if nothing else. Seek my arms, legs, and torso. I will give you anything you want. Power, riches beyond <NUMBER>! Anything!"
"We are two imps, little demonic people. We want to play a game. Okay, big peoples... this is how our game will go! There is <NUMBER> chests here with nothings in them! In front of each empty chest, a famous big people will appear! Famous big people! Oh, yes, powerful famous big people! Each famous big people will give you a gift that belongs to another famous big people... and they will hints to you what gifts belong to them! If you thinks you knows which famous big people a gift belongs to, you puts it in the empty chest behind them, yes? Very simple! Once you places all <NUMBER>, you comes and asks us! If you wrong, we laugh at you! If you right, we open the <NUMBER> chest! The <NUMBER> chest has all of the drow's treasure! All of it!"
"Hey! It's me, <CHARACTER>. I... I've found you again, my noble ranger! It's... it's so hard to find you sometimes! The... the <PLACE> is in danger again! The Minister has asked for you! It's <ENEMY>! The witch! She's come back, and she's threatened to kill everyone if they don't go an' leave right now! The... the Minister says he will tell you everything!"
"<CHARACTER>! That... that fat excuse for a slaver, he's cursed me! Damn him! If the curse was tailored to me, it might resist removal by normal means. I doubt <CHARACTER> would have done this if the solution were simple. I have a few options. <CHARACTER> mentioned that <CHARACTER> lived in squalor, suggesting <CHARACTER> may be in the poor section of the <PLACE>. Not likely to find <CHARACTER> quick though. The mages with <CHARACTER> wore odd colors that might be traceable. Ask at the government building, as all magic is regulated in <PLACE>. If they will talk... <CHARACTER> also mentioned <ENEMY>, a merchant that helped expose <CHARACTER>. <ENEMY> frequents the <PLACE>, and the bartender Bernard might know <ENEMY>'s whereabouts. My very bones ache today. It is as though I age on the inside. Ohh, this cannot go on for long. <SOA>We must remove this curse!<EOA>"
"Greetings, traveler. I am Sir Ryan Trawl. I have heard of you. I would like to offer you the opportunity to help the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. The task of being a paladin is not easy. Many break under the demands of our path and leave to pursue avenues of life more appropriate to their talents. Sometimes they bend instead of break, twisting their paladinhood to serve their own purpose. These are hard to detect, but when found, they are quickly cast out. Recently, one of our highest-ranking officers was implicated in smuggling slaves. His name is <CHARACTER>, and though <CHARACTER> was once a friend, <CHARACTER> was expelled from the Order. We thought that the end of it, but <CHARACTER> took others when <CHARACTER> left. <CHARACTER> is a charismatic <ENEMY>, and some of the younger knights were swayed by <CHARACTER>'s words. We could tolerate their loss, but they masquerade as paladins, abusing our good name. They extort, smuggle slaves, and spit on all that we honor. The Fallen Paladins, as they're known, would recognize any of our Order, and some also fear conflict with former friends, so we need outside help in this matter. The Fallen Paladins always need warriors to aid their illegal activities. We want you to ally with them, especially <CHARACTER>. <CHARACTER>'s the key to them all. If you consider these men a threat, then do what you think is necessary. <ITEM>s of Healing would be a suitable reward for the task, I think. <CHARACTER> has kept their activities localized in the <PLACE> District. I suggest you search there. May <ENEMY> be with you."
"Oh, <CHARACTER>! Thank the gods that I've found you! I've hurt <CHARACTER>! You have to save <CHARACTER>! I didn't mean to do it. I bought a love potion from <CHARACTER> the peddler at the market square. I just wanted <CHARACTER> to love me. <CHARACTER> only had a sip of it, and <CHARACTER> collapsed. <CHARACTER> is with your mother, <CHARACTER>. How was I to know it was poison? Oh, please hurry! I will meet you in <PLACE>."
"I'm Lieutenant Aegisfield. I'm warning everyone so as to get the word out that there are guards on the streets. We've had a... a string of killings, and I don't want any more happening. <ENEMY> I can understand; they are easy enough to figure out. What's happening here is... it's murder, but not like I've ever seen. There's a disgustingly sick person out there, and I simply don't have the manpower to protect everyone. <CHARACTER>'s been killing paupers, sometimes in the alley where they sleep. They have nothing to take. <CHARACTER> kills them and that is all. Not only is it pointless, but <CHARACTER> does it in as painful a way as possible. It's... it's sick. <CHARACTER> flays them... alive. There has been blood all over the area. I must go about my rounds. If you find any information about the murders, be sure to let me know. Don't go looking for trouble though."
"Hail there! I said I would return, and I have. Sorry to have kept you waiting, but there were things I had to take care of. Now that we have met once again, there is something I must ask of you. We must go to the <ENEMY> Hold in <PLACE>. I have been asked to bring you, and we must go soon. They will allow us to pass the wards of the door, but I must be with you."
"I'm Therndle Daglefodd, a merchant. My child, <CHARACTER> Daglefodd, has been missing for a tunnel's worth of digging. I simply cannot work without knowing <CHARACTER>'s fate. <SOA>Could you have a look for <CHARACTER>?<EOA>"
"Ah! It is the hero of <PLACE>, come to see me at last. I trust that all is well? That pig, <CHARACTER> <ENEMY>, did not speak too harshly about me, I trust? No matter. He is a stubborn, deluded fool. Our families have been at odds for generations, you see. The <ENEMY> <CHARACTER>s refuse to acknowledge the fact that we are the only true noble family in <PLACE>, having founded it. Why they would think themselves higher than they are is beyond my ken. What is unfortunate, however, is that my family has never had actual, physical proof of the truth of our claim. That has changed, however. A tome has recently been uncovered... an old tome belonging to my family... that states there is proof right here in <PLACE> under our noses. In the graveyard, here in town, lies the crypt of the founder... my ancestor. With him lies the <ITEM> of <ITEM>. A pretty name for an old gold circlet. That circlet, however, would prove my claim once and for all and shut those <ENEMY> <CHARACTER>s up. I would get it myself, but the tomb is haunted, you see. Here is the key to the tomb... the fact that we possess it is yet more proof of our legitimacy. Use it to enter and obtain the <ITEM>, and then return to me when you are done. You are a hero <SOA>who might enter that tomb and retrieve the circlet for me<EOA>, if you are willing. In return, I will pay you <NUMBER> gold. What do you say, my hero?"
"I will give you your next assignment. The <ENEMY> <CHARACTER>s have other enemies besides me. Recently, they uncovered a traitor, and have been questioning him quite ruthlessly for some days now. You will rescue him. He will be killed once they are through, so go quickly. They have him at the <ENEMY> <CHARACTER> guild house on the second floor. You know the building, I think? The man's name is <CHARACTER> Flynn. Remember, if he dies, you fail. Good luck."
"Now I ask for a more specific task that will disrupt the <ENEMY> <CHARACTER>s further. The task is... unseemly. It calls for the murder of a man. Not a truly innocent man, but hardly a villain of epic scope. You must kill, blaming the murder on the <ENEMY> <CHARACTER>s. He is head of a merchant house, and his link to <ENEMY> <CHARACTER>s is blatant. If he were to die and certain gear were at the scene, it would implicate the guild we oppose. Take this <ITEM> and <ITEM>, and go kill Senior <CHARACTER> <ENEMY>. When he is dead, put the <ITEM> and <ITEM> in the fountain in his house. He will die easily, though there may be guards. His small house is in the Government District, between the jail and the government building. <SOA>Go.<EOA>"
"Again, I require your talents. Now to the task at hand. It is time to take down the leadership of the <ENEMY> <CHARACTER>s and throw them into a more permanent disarray from which they may not recover. You must invade their lair one last time. You must kill <CHARACTER> Linvail, the <ENEMY>. Do this for me, and our arrangement will be fulfilled. <CHARACTER> is in the basement of the <ENEMY> <CHARACTER> guild house, so you need a key. The lock is likely unpickable. What good is a lock in a <ENEMY> <CHARACTER>s' guild if any <ENEMY> <CHARACTER> can pick it? One more thing: <CHARACTER>, an employee of mine, is missing, and the <ENEMY> <CHARACTER>s may have him. <SOA>Find him, and he may tell you how to access <CHARACTER>'s sanctum<EOA>. <SOA>Go now!<EOA>"
"Greetings. I am <CHARACTER>. I represent one of the masters of the <PLACE> order of the Cowled Wizards. He seeks to employ you in a matter of some urgency. The matter is most sensitive... I have been given little knowledge of it. <CHARACTER>, the one whom I speak for, is eager to meet with you and discuss these matters. Master <CHARACTER> can be found in the government building behind me... you may go within. Do not tarry overlong, my friend."
"I am <CHARACTER>, a proud member of the <PLACE> Cowled Wizards. This matter must be handled with discretion and expediency. There is something that has been plaguing us for more than a week now and has become quite alarming. You know of the prevailing attitude against magic here in <PLACE>, yes? Well, amongst some it is even worse than that... a burning, palpable hatred. One particular man here in <PLACE> has murdered two of our number in cold blood. He is currently in hiding, and we need you to track the fellow down. We have been unable to do so, much to our frustration. Cowled Wizards cannot be assaulted without repercussions or it will lead to... serious problems. He is <CHARACTER> Corthala, last son of a wealthy family and a true brute. Ask around and you may discover if he is hiding within the city or someplace else. He has a home here in the Docks District, or he may have fled to the Umar Hills. His friends and servants will not speak to us, but they may to you. We do not ask that you commit any murder. We wish <CHARACTER> be delivered to us, that is all. He will likely resist, so <SOA>if you must kill him, so be it<EOA>. But if you do kill him, I simply must have his body. <CHARACTER> must be delivered to us whether he is dead or alive. You understand, yes?"
"Welcome to my humble accommodations, adventurer. Will you hear out my tale? As I said before, my name is <CHARACTER>... I hail from <PLACE> to the south, where I was a merchant. A successful one. I... suppose that is where I first came into contact with <ENEMY>. <ENEMY> is a lich, adventurer. A powerful one. In <PLACE>, there are many strange wonders of magic, and <ENEMY> is not out of place. It is <ENEMY> who has chased us here, hunting us mercilessly. <ENEMY> desired my poor <ITEM>, my daughter. She is the young woman here on the bed. A... a good girl, a virgin and pure of heart. <ENEMY> desired her soul, <ENEMY> said, so I fled <PLACE> with her. But <ENEMY> caught up to us nevertheless. And somehow <ENEMY> has taken her soul despite my efforts! She... she lies near death, and there is nothing the local priestess can do to help her. I know <ENEMY> is in the cavern that serves as a graveyard in this <PLACE>. I told the monks about him... but they sealed off the cavern rather than somehow getting my daughter's soul back as I had hoped. <ITEM> is the world to me! And I do not know how much longer <ENEMY> will remain trapped in that cavern... he could already be loose! He will kill me and keep <ITEM>'s soul, I am sure of it! Getting inside the cavern is not a problem. I... paid the guard there what little money I have left. I had thought to... try and get <ITEM>'s soul myself. But the guard will let in whomever I ask him to. I have no coin left to offer you. I have bankrupted myself in trying to flee the lich's reach. But... <ENEMY> himself is a powerful wizard. Surely he has items that would interest you, that you could take from him!"
"Welcome to this <PLACE>. I've looked forward to seeing you. I am, as you know, <CHARACTER>. Strange things are afoot on the docks. Shipments are disappearing, as are my employees with them. We are significantly weakened by this. I think it unlikely you would be captured or wooed to the <ENEMY>. If you go to the docks and bolster the guard on the shipments, it will strengthen our position. Go at night, and you will find my present guard captain there already, a woman by the name of <CHARACTER>. Take note of anything odd that happens. Good hunting. Report to me if anything happens. Oh, and the reward I have set aside for you... I'll let you have some magical <ITEM>s. You will find them useful, I am sure."
"Two of our men, <CHARACTER> and <CHARACTER> by name, are planning to leave our little community and join with our <ENEMY>. Greener grass and all of that, I suppose. They are to meet their contact on the second floor of the Five Flagons tavern in the Bridge District. Go there and pose as one of our <ENEMY>'s new recruits. I want to know where our <ENEMY>'s lair is. We have yet to find it. This recruiter could arrive at any time so I suggest that you go to the Five Flagons now. They may prove unreasonable, so prepare yourself for hostility. <SOA>Return when you have the information we need<EOA>."

"Traveler, I'm worried about my fellow villagers here in the <PLACE>. I don't think that they eat enough nutritious, tasty <ITEM>. Could you help me gather more? I simply can't catch enough <ITEM> for everyone, even if I'm a pro fisherman. There is a river, <PLACE>, bountiful in <ITEM> near here. You could try your luck there, and <SOA>catch <NUMBER> <ITEM> for me<EOA>. <SOA>I could pay you <NUMBER> <ITEM> for the <ITEM><EOA>."
"Some incredibly foolish individual's been throwing <ITEM> all over our <PLACE>! Now the whole place is crawling with <ENEMY>! Could you take care of those little critters before they cause any serious issues? <SOA>Kill them all<EOA>, and receive <NUMBER> <ITEM> for your trouble. You would have all our thanks, too."
"Hail friend! It's good to see you. I'd offer you something to drink, but I'm running low on refreshments, and quite thirsty myself. We are in a <PLACE>, after all. There's not much water around... Now that I think of it... <SOA>You could actually help the whole <PLACE> by obtaining us a permanent source of water!<EOA> Build us a well, please. Ahh, I can already taste the fresh water on my lips... I could give you this bucket of lava in exchange for a well. Just don't do anything mischievous with it, or burn yourself!"
"What are YOU doing here! If it was up to me, I'd never let you in the <PLACE>. Perhaps you'd like to mend our relations? Bring me some <ITEM> ore, the more the better. You can never have enough of it; it's so beautiful. My <ITEM>. I wish to have it all to myself. Too bad it's mainly found in the ore veins deep in the ground. I guess you could have these <ITEM> seeds as a reward. I have no use for them; <ITEM> have nothing on <ITEM>."
"My child, my temple could use a donation. I have to tend the sick and needy: I cannot procure all my potion ingredients myself. I often have to participate in rather complicated trades for the ingredients. Please, help a humble servant of the Gods: bring me <NUMBER> <ITEM>s. I know that they are rare, but <SOA>you can find still find them in ancient ruins<EOA>, and even deep within the Overworld itself. I have a vast surplus of some potion ingredients that cannot be traded further: I can give you <NUMBER> Glowstone Dust for your time and effort."
"I'm sick and tired of eating the same boring, mundane <ITEM> every day. I want to taste something a bit more refined. Something like golden <ITEM>. Could you help a lady in distress? Bring me <NUMBER> golden <ITEM> to sample from, and I'll procure you a <ITEM> block. That should leave a sweet taste in your mouth, as well. Golden <ITEM> can be found in various dangerous corners of the world. If you don't fancy exploring, you can craft golden <ITEM> by combining an <ITEM> with <ITEM> ingots."
"I'd like to redecorate my home. Stranger, <SOA>could you do a man a favor? Obtain <NUMBER><EOA> red banners and bring them to me. I have heard that you can craft banners from sticks and <ITEM>. I'll have <NUMBER> <ITEM> for you."
"You must be the hero I have heard so much about. I have a small task for you; it should be child's play for one such as yourself. There is someone I really care about. I'd like to gift them some flowers, perhaps some of those nice, deep red <ITEM>. Please, <SOA>bring me <NUMBER> <ITEM><EOA>. You can gather them almost everywhere outdoors in plains and forests. I'll have <NUMBER> emeralds waiting for you..."
"I want to make my leather works more... dashing and colorful. <SOA>Bring me <NUMBER> cyan dye<EOA>, and I'll reward you with <NUMBER> emeralds. You can make cyan dye by combining green dye with blue dye, I think. I'd obtain the dye myself, but the smell of my tanning chemicals attracts all sorts of unsavory <ENEMY> to me out there."
"My friend, as you might know, I'm not a <CHARACTER> to say no to the sweeter temptations in life. I'd be overjoyed if you baked me a delicious cake and brought it to me. I'm not leaving you hanging either: I have <NUMBER> golden apples for you."
"Great timing, Hero. I'm suffering... my poor heart is writhing in love. Help me find a rose for my loved one, so that my heart may yet calm down. All I need is but a single rose. They can be found in various temperate forests. Please, <SOA>help a fellow in love<EOA>. I have <NUMBER> pumpkin pies I can give you."
"I know of your dark deeds. I do not want any trouble from you. However... if you have had a change of heart, I could use a little help. The hot desert air of this <PLACE> is making me rather uncomfortable. I could stave off the heat if I had some ice. Tell you what, <SOA>bring me ice<EOA>, and you may still redeem yourself, villain, and net yourself <NUMBER> cacti. Ice is commonplace in snowy tundras, in frosted rivers."
"Dear friend, this <PLACE> is freezing cold, isn't it? This cold is turning my fingers blue, at least. You are a highly skilled individual. May I ask you to craft a campfire or two? First, you have to collect some materials: <NUMBER> sticks, a piece of coal, and <NUMBER> wood logs. After crafting the campfires, <SOA>please give them to me<EOA>. I even have something for you: <NUMBER> Blue Ice. It's slippery, blue-colored ice. I'm sure it'll prove useful to you, my friend."
"You are the <CHARACTER> who's been causing trouble in these parts, aren't you? Why don't we put your energy to a better use? I'm a mason, which means that I have to move large quantities of stone from one <PLACE> to another. I'd like to automate that process with pistons. That would save me from backache. The problem is I don't have the materials for making pistons, or the know-how to craft them. This is where you enter the picture. <SOA>Craft <NUMBER> pistons, and then bring them to me<EOA>. I know that you need <NUMBER> wooden planks, <NUMBER> cobblestone, an iron ingot, and Redstone Dust for crafting a piston. Some quarts pillars broke while we were transporting them. You could have the remaining <NUMBER> Nether Quartz from them."
"Gee! You okay? looks at you with a blank expression You look a dark <CHARACTER>-thing. Me think me know the right think to cheer you up! A quest. Me want one of those music disc thingies. <SOA>Find one?<EOA> Get <NUMBER> blocks of emerald in return."
"Me hurt me often. Other <CHARACTER> suggest me get a helmet to protect me head. Me seen turtles on sandy <PLACE>s. They never get hurt, because they hide in thick shells. <SOA>You give me a turtle shell?<EOA> <SOA>Make me safe?<EOA> Me give you this sharp stick in return. It a <ITEM> sword. It pretty, but me hurt plenty after touching it."
"I've been pondering about something. <PLACE> legends tell that <ENEMY>s drop something very peculiar when killed by skeletons. I have heard that you are a helpful person. <SOA>Could you perhaps collect that <ITEM> and report back to me?<EOA> You just have to figure out how to get a skeleton kill a <ENEMY>. This might be a difficult task to accomplish. You will be rewarded accordingly: <NUMBER> blocks of diamond. Surely you too are curious about what happens."
"No! Go away! Please don't kill me... <ENEMY>s are making me scared enough already! Perhaps you'd like to do something villainous, and even net a reward for it? This <PLACE>, Fishing Hamlet, has been threatened by nearby <ENEMY>s of Deepwood Tower for some time. <SOA>You could go to their tower in the woods<EOA> and <SOA>steal their plans<EOA>. <SOA>Bring the plans to me<EOA>, and I'll give you an enchanted sword as a reward. Just don't test its blade on me, please!"
"I am a farmer here in <PLACE> Settlement. Sometimes, I get a bountiful harvest of melons. I process most of the melons into glistering melon slices for clerics and their important healing <ITEM>s. I actually just finished preparing some glistering melon slices. <SOA>Could you please take them to the cleric in the <PLACE> of Humming Hills?<EOA> I'm sure she'll pay you for them."
"I used to be an adventurer. I braved the depths of this world like no one else before me. I still have one of my healing <ITEM>s as a memento from those days of glory. That <ITEM> is quite special... Now that I think of it, the local cleric, Pope, might want to examine it for its peculiar properties. He could make some potent healing <ITEM>s after researching my special <ITEM>. <SOA>Could you please find him and give him the <ITEM>?<EOA> The cleric will surely give you a small compensation fee."
"I need the help of an outsider. I think one of the villagers here works for <ENEMY>s in secret! They could be planning an attack on Desert Refuge! <SOA>Would you please investigate this matter for me?<EOA> Try to obtain Suspicious Man's journal. It should shed light on his actions. I'm even willing to reward you with <NUMBER> emeralds. What are a few gems to peace of mind?"
"My daddy said that <CHARACTER>s and <CHARACTER>s can make babies together. I want to see what their babies look like! You are a grown-up! You ought to know how to tame and breed animals. Please show me a baby <CHARACTER>! I have seen both <CHARACTER>s and <CHARACTER>s eating grass an plains and savannas. <SOA>Try to tame one of both and make them breed!<EOA> <SOA>Show me a baby <CHARACTER><EOA>, and I'll give you some golden <ITEM>s. They're incredibly tasty... and so shiny!"
"I have a task for you, stranger. And I'm willing to give you something precious in return. There are age-old tales of strong, volcanic glass. This glass is known as <ITEM>. I'd love to try out my masonry on <ITEM>! The tales also say that you can make <ITEM> by directing water on lava pools. There are many such pools underground in deep <PLACE>s. I would ask you to mine out some <ITEM> blocks for me. I'm not built for adventure myself: carving stones is all I know."]
"I've caught a mountain of <ITEM> and <ITEM>. Yet, there are still some more exotic <ITEM> that have eluded my <ITEM> rod. Traveler, do you like <ITEM>ing? May I ask you to catch <NUMBER> tropical <ITEM> for me? These sort of <ITEM> are common in vast oceans of our <PLACE>. I yearn to take a look at new kinds of <ITEM>. I could even try to breed them. <SOA>If you happen to give me <NUMBER> exotic <ITEM><EOA>, I'll be glad to reward you with an enchanted <ITEM> rod of mine. A best kind of tool for a passionate <ITEM>."
"I've been told that there are <CHARACTER>s in all possible colors; not just black, gray, white and brown. I'm not the sharpest <CHARACTER> around. You seem like a clever person: perhaps you know how to find these colorful <CHARACTER>s. <CHARACTER>s love grass; they tend to stay in grassy <PLACE>s. Let me have some colorful, beautiful <CHARACTER>s. I want to test breeding a flock of <CHARACTER>s in all colors of the rainbow. I'll let you have a pile of regular ole white <ITEM>."
"The ship sank. All those poor <CHARACTER>s have now passed the veil to the other side. This is a sad day for us all. My friend, that ship carried important <ITEM> ingredient for our <PLACE>. Most of the goods that are not produced here are transported here by the sea. Now I can't fashion remedies for our villagers, and the next shipment will not be here for a long time. You are a good person. I ask you to <SOA>find a bundle of life-saving <ITEM> ingredients for me<EOA>. That would mean a lot for the whole <PLACE>! The bundle should be in the sunken ship east of here. Here, this <ITEM> of water breathing should help you dive to the ship save and sound. I'll even let you have my old, extra brewing stand as a gift upon your return. Be careful while you dive; there a many lethal things lurking beneath the waves. I'd hate to bury a friend."
"Oh... You're that dark <ENEMY>. This is just like one of my adventure novels! So exciting! Perhaps you happen to know Spook. He's a kooky novelist who lives in an igloo to the north. You should get along with him splendidly! And whole you are there, you <SOA>could even get his new book for me<EOA>. I need to know what events unfold in that one! Evil machinations need funding, don't they? Well, do my little book-fetching mission, and gain an enchanted book. I love books, but that one flew over my head... literally!."
"I just escaped with my life from a friggin' Elder <ENEMY>, and now I run into you, my least favorite person in the whole world. The damn Elder <ENEMY> swallowed the hook, line, and sinker of my <ITEM> rod while I was out in the sea <ITEM>ing on my boat. It must have eaten the whole <ITEM> rod after it slipped from my grip into the sea. I shouldn't have gone <ITEM> so close to the ocean monument far south of this <PLACE>. I just couldn't see the turquoise stones that make up the monument before it was too late. Who even built those dangerous underwater temples anyway? I have a proposition for you: recover my <ITEM> rod from the Elder <ENEMY>, and I'll set you up with enough cooked <ITEM> to last your lifetime. We might even become friends. First, you have to <SOA>find the Elder <ENEMY><EOA>, and <SOA>kill it<EOA>. Elder <ENEMY>s are one-eyed, large, pale, evil pufferfish. They can shoot laser, and make you fatigued when you get close to them."
"<ITEM>s are awesome! I love everything about them! Their texture, their taste... Some travelers claim to have seen some huge, giant <ITEM>s that stand as tall as trees. I want to see one for real! Could you help me see a huge <ITEM>? You are a traveler: you must know how to grow huge <ITEM>s. Please find a regular <ITEM> from a <PLACE> shielded from direct sunlight, and find a way to grow it into a huge <ITEM> somewhere where I can see it. Report <SOA>back to me after growing a huge <ITEM><EOA>, and <SOA>I'll reward you with a bunch of golden carrots<EOA>. They are tasty, but I prefer <ITEM>s. Especially steamy, hot <ITEM> stew that waters one's mouth."
"My job is to sell <ITEM> of all sorts: both cooked and raw. I take pride in my craftsmanship: I always try to find new, improved ways to cook <ITEM>. I have a hypothesis: the fuel used in my oven affects the taste of the <ITEM> that's cooked in it. I'd like to test out different materials to feed the flames of my oven: a bucket of <ITEM>, a blaze rod, and a block of <ITEM>, for starters. Would you help a butcher better her craft? Bring the items I mentioned to me, and I'll cook you a year's worth of steak. <ITEM> can be found in pools deep under the ground. I'll give you a bucket for scooping out the <ITEM>. Blaze rods a trickier to obtain; you have to brave the hellscape that is the <PLACE>. <ITEM>, on the contrary, is quite easy to get. Just <SOA>look out for ore veins seated in stone<EOA>."
"My friend, I've got a profitable deal for you today. As you know, I smith weapons from a variety of materials, including diamond. Just so it happens, I'm running low on <ITEM>s: soon I can't make any diamond swords for daring adventurers. I'm not skilled in adventuring; I can't brave the deep underground for diamond veins. Yet, I have a whopping block of Netherite. You definitely don't see those every day! Here's the deal: <SOA>bring me <NUMBER> blocks of diamond<EOA>, and I'll give you my block of Netherite. A good deal for a good friend."
"Me useless moron, say many people of this <PLACE>. Me want to seem like a hero instead. Would make I happier, less thinking of dying. Me know!!! Go to The End. That strange <PLACE> at the end. <SOA>Kill that big meanie <ENEMY><EOA>. Tell I how you did it, and me can tell everyone me did it! Me give you something cool for me white lie."
"I want to become famous. Just not quite like you, hero. I seek to become the best armorer in the world. To do that, I need a lot of practice in hammering down pieces of armor. Would you please bring me <NUMBER> blocks of iron? Those should help me become a better armorer in no time! First, you have to <SOA>get iron ore from the many iron veins in the <PLACE><EOA>. Next, you'll want to <SOA>smelt the ore into iron ingots in a furnace somewhere<EOA>. Lastly, you ought to craft those iron ingots into blocks of iron on a crafting table. <SOA>Do all that<EOA>, and I promise to outfit you in better armor than what you are wearing now!"
"I really want to see something more interesting than the bounds of this <PLACE>. That would also elevate my status among the other villagers. Traveler, can you take me to the Nether? I want see that hellish realm myself, but I can't fend off its dangers all by myself. Let us explore the place together. You will also get a fair reward for being my guide in the Nether: <NUMBER> diamonds. Don't spend them all at once."
"The guys in this <PLACE> rarely take note of me. I want to dye my hair red to make myself more attractive. Wandering traders often have red dye. <SOA>Could you find some <ITEM><EOA> and <SOA>give it to me?<EOA> I'd give you <NUMBER> emeralds for the red dye."
"No one in this <PLACE> buys the beautiful stones cut by me. I'm a failure of a mason! <CHARACTER>, could you promote my stoneworks? I really could use more customers. This <PLACE> is quite large, there ought to be at least a few villagers who might be interested in my stone bricks and other stoneworks. Just hand out some promotional pamphlets to the villagers of Stoneburg. You'll even net a load of emeralds for your services, my <CHARACTER>."
"I am most certainly not going to sing your praises, you nasty <ENEMY>. On the contrary, it would be music to my ears if you helped me reach my musical ambitions. No one in this <PLACE> seems to care for music, or any of the arts for that matter. For starters, obtain <NUMBER> note blocks. It has to be exactly <NUMBER>, because there are that many different notes to play. It's possible to craft note blocks from wooden planks and redstone dust. <SOA>Bring the <NUMBER> note blocks to me<EOA>. I'll let you have an old music disc of mine."
"I want all <ENEMY> in this <PLACE> know how much I hate them. Perhaps I could get some of their heads to show my disdain toward them. <ENEMY> heads should show all <ENEMY>s that I am not to be trifled with. You will certainly help me; many people in this <PLACE> have told me that you are a resourceful and eager to work. Bring me five <ENEMY> heads. Powerful <ENEMY>s are somehow related to getting the heads, but I don't know how exactly. <SOA>Get me the heads<EOA>, and I'll give you wings that let you soar the skies: an Elytra."
"<CHARACTER> is dead, just like all the others. You continue to impress me, Silencer, and I am only too eager to indulge your homicidal instincts. Your next target is a savage <ENEMY> barbarian, living alone and exposed at a small campsite on the summit of <PLACE> Mountain. This barbarian, <CHARACTER> by name, savagely butchered the chieftain of a mead hall on the island of <PLACE>. The chieftain's sister has forgone the <ENEMY> custom of extracting the monetary retribution of wergild, and instead wants <CHARACTER> to pay with his life. You, dear Silencer, will help put her family at peace. You are to <SOA>go to <PLACE> Mountain<EOA>, <SOA>locate <CHARACTER><EOA>, and send <SOA>his soul to the great beyond<EOA>. When <CHARACTER> has been executed, journey to the ancient ruin of <PLACE>. In the flooded section of that ruin, you will find a chest, submerged in the water. As you may have guessed, the chest contains your reward for killing <CHARACTER>, <NUMBER> gold, and your next contract."
"I'm <CHARACTER>, the Count's butler. So you want to buy a house? I can speak for the Count. <PLACE> Hall is a stately manor currently occupied by <CHARACTER>. You won't find a better property for sale in <PLACE>. It's just inside the main gate, near the bridge to the chapel. The house costs <NUMBER> septims. Give me the septims, and I will order the deed to the house drawn up. Don't worry about <CHARACTER>. I'll have him evicted. I'm sure he'll find another home easily."
"It is a pleasure to meet you. I am <CHARACTER> of <PLACE>. Are you looking for a house to buy? There is a positively gorgeous home for sale right on the main plaza. You'll be hard pressed to find a nicer home for sale in <PLACE>. The house is called <PLACE>, and it costs <NUMBER> gold to buy the house from me. It would be a pleasure to have you become a citizen of <PLACE>. The last tenant of <PLACE> has cleaned the place of furniture. I'd recommend stopping by <PLACE> Goods and Trade. The owner, <CHARACTER>, should have everything you need."
"I'm <CHARACTER>. I'm sorry to impose upon you like this, but I'm in need of assistance, and I don't know what to do. My husband, <CHARACTER>, is missing. It all started when <CHARACTER> became foolish and started gambling. He'd visit the arena every week and spend our hard-earned money on bets. I told him to stop, but he didn't listen. He was certain he could win us a fortune and move us somewhere nicer, like the <PLACE>. It didn't take long for <CHARACTER> to begin losing. He resorted to borrowing money from a usurer to cover his losses and place new bets. As you can imagine, it didn't pay off. He ended up owing around <NUMBER> gold. We could never have that kind of money to pay back the usurer. Yesterday, the usurer, <CHARACTER> gro, sent for my husband to meet him at the <PLACE>. He hasn't returned since. I fear for his life. <CHARACTER> isn't known for his patience. Please, I'm not wealthy, but I'd give anything to see <CHARACTER> again. Please, <SOA>find <CHARACTER><EOA>. Farewell, and be careful, <CHARACTER> is not to be trusted."
"I am <CHARACTER> of <PLACE>. I wish I had time to chat, but I'm afraid I am in the middle of an investigation. You seem the trusting type. Perhaps you can assist me? It seems someone has taken away an heirloom that is quite dear to me. I want you to help me recover a stolen painting. The painting was of my lost love, the <CHARACTER>, and it has been stolen from my bedchamber. If you <SOA> the painting and bring the culprit to justice<EOA>, you shall be justly rewarded. I suggest you begin to gather clues. And I warn you: do not accuse the wrong person, or I shall be quite cross with you. Here are some keys. They should allow you access to many of the restricted areas in Castle <PLACE>."
"<CHARACTER>, Count of <PLACE>. So you're looking for a house to buy here in <PLACE>? Really? It just so happens there is a modest shack overlooking the canal. It's not much to look at, but the smell will soon make you forget how ugly it is. Pay me <NUMBER> gold, and it's all yours. I'll have my steward register the deed of ownership. It's a squalid little shack, I'm sorry to say. Oh, and the place is fairly bare. If I were you, I'd <SOA>head on over to <CHARACTER> at The <PLACE><EOA> and <SOA>get some furnishings<EOA>. Or you could always eat off the floor... doesn't matter to me."
"<CHARACTER>, Office of Imperial Commerce. You desire a house in the Imperial City? Why? I mean... of course. All I have available right now is a hovel on the Waterfront. It's yours for a mere <NUMBER> septims. You may give those septims to me. You'll find the house in the Waterfront District. It's not much to look at. You may want to spruce it up a bit with some furnishings. I'd suggest talking to <CHARACTER> at Three Brothers Trade Goods in the Market District."
"About time someone showed up. Thank you for freeing me. I'm <CHARACTER> gro, the <PLACE>'s bouncer and helmsman. I've been locked in that storage room for hours. I don't know exactly what's going on, but not long ago, a gang of thieves calling themselves The <ENEMY> stormed the ship. They took myself and <CHARACTER>, the <PLACE>'s owner, hostage and put the ship to sea. I have no idea what they're after. If you can get me safely to the top deck, I can steer the <ENEMY> home. But I'm not budging until the coast is clear. I'm used to dealing with drunken louts, not a gang of well-armed <ENEMY>. Good luck... you'll need it."
"Hail knight! I am <CHARACTER> Whitestrake, whose Relics you seek with a worthy heart! Your prayers have woken me from my endless dream. Or perhaps you have entered my dream, and I still sleep. I think others have sometimes spoken to me, others like you, but my memory is doubtful. Perhaps the others came after you. Your need must be great for the gods to allow us to speak. Has <ENEMY> the Accursed found a way back? The foulest of a foul race. A thousand curses upon his unholy name! I thought I'd won. But I should have known. The <ENEMY> are a cunning breed. <ENEMY> found a way to cheat death, as I could not. If you would seek for my Relics, I know little that can help you. All that has passed since my death is like mist that my mind cannot take hold of. My friends built a shrine upon the site of my death, <PLACE>, where the <ENEMY> tormented me in a final act of revenge. I can show you where it once stood. Perhaps it is there still. Fare thee well, sir knight. May the gods grant you to destroy <ENEMY> utterly, as I failed to do."
"Hear my final passings of praise and wisdom! You have stepped from the humble shadows of obscurity and into legend. No feat you have accomplished in your life compares to what you have become. You are an embodiment of <CHARACTER> Whitestrake, the bane of <ENEMY> the Unfeathered. The time has come for you to fulfill your destiny. <ENEMY> lies hid in the ancient fane of Garlas Malatar. You must go there and destroy him. <ENEMY>'s Daedric nature allows his spirit to escape into Oblivion after death. This is what <CHARACTER> learned upon defeating <ENEMY> the first time. You must first kill his living body. While beyond the power of most mortals, this is only the lesser of your two tasks. It will allow you to <SOA>follow <ENEMY> into the spirit realm upon his death<EOA>. It will allow you to destroy him, body and soul, utterly and for all time."
"I am <CHARACTER> Ulven, a botanist. You're offering to help me with my research? Well... I suppose I could find a use for you, despite your lack of training. Collect some plants for me, will you? Here's the list of things I need. Get me everything on it. <SOA>Try to remember where you found it so you can tell me<EOA>. It's important. I will pay you <NUMBER> gold coins for each sample."
"I am <CHARACTER>, Chamberlain to the Lord <CHARACTER>. You approach the <PLACE>. Through the door behind me lies the realm of <CHARACTER>, Prince of Madness, Lord of the Never-There. My Lord seeks a mortal to act as His Champion. Perhaps the Lord <CHARACTER> will find a use for you. You'll want to pass through the Gates of Madness. Oh, and mind the Gatekeeper. He dislikes strangers to the Realm."
"By the strength and guidance of the Nine, who comes before us upon this sacred <PLACE> seeking the <ITEM> of the Divine <CHARACTER>? Step forward, adventurer, and face us, the <CHARACTER>s of the Nine, each in honorable combat. For the vows we failed to revere in life, we shall uphold in death. No unworthy soul shall lay hands upon this sacred <ITEM> without the leave of the <CHARACTER>s of the Nine."
"Excuse me. I'm innkeeper <CHARACTER>. We have a small problem that we hope you can help us with. You may be wondering why you can't see me. We are all wondering the same thing. Everyone in <PLACE> suddenly became invisible several weeks ago. It was sort of fun at first, but the novelty has definitely worn off now. You can imagine how difficult it is to run an inn while invisible. Once you get a reputation as a haunted inn, you can just forget about it. So we've all been keeping quiet, hoping the spell will wear off. But we're running out of patience. We're sure it was <ENEMY>'s doing, but we can't find him. If you can help us, we will be extremely grateful. <ENEMY>'s a <CHARACTER> who took up residence in the ruins of <PLACE> a couple of years ago. He's caused us no end of trouble with his magical experiments, but nothing as bad as this. We've tried to find him, but had no luck. If he's still living in the fort, he's hiding from us, and no wonder. If you could find him and get him to remove this cursed invisibility, we will all be in your debt. The ruined fort is just to the southeast of here. Follow the path down the hill. But watch out for the invisible <ENEMY>s that infest the ruins! If you make us visible again, you'd be welcome at the <PLACE> Inn anytime. Free of charge."
"Oh my. To what do I owe this honor? I am but a humble <CHARACTER>. What business do you have with me? You would quest for the holy panoply of <CHARACTER>? The legendary Relics that have been sought by mighty warriors throughout the ages? Are you a worthy knight? The gods grant insight to those they deem worthy. Why and how they act is not predictable. What I can tell you is that traditionally, knights who wished to quest for the Relics would walk the Pilgrim's Way. Travel to the Wayshrines of the Nine Divines. Pray to each of the gods in turn, and ask their favor upon your quest."
"These stupid <ENEMY>s are driving me crazy! I'm at my wit's end! I, <CHARACTER>, beg you to help me! The beastly little creatures are nasty, smelly, noisy and wrecking my beautiful house! I must be rid of them! I can't let people know I have <ENEMY>s in here, or they'll think I've taken to Daedra worship. Try explaining that to the town guard. I had a feeling buying that Daedric <ITEM> would be trouble. Now I'm paying for it with more than just some gold. A few weeks ago, a spellsword was passing through <PLACE> and heard that I like to buy curiosities. He wanted to sell the <ITEM> you see me carrying. I eagerly bought it, knowing the value of Daedric relics. In fact, I was a bit suspicious when he sold it so cheap. His loss, my gain I figured. After examining it for a bit I noticed a small word carved on it in runes. Using a book from my library, I translated it. The word was nonsense. However, when I spoke it and held the <ITEM>, four <ENEMY>s suddenly appeared! I thought I was done for! Strangely, they all just stood there. It didn't take long before I realized they were following me! I couldn't be seen in town with <ENEMY>s following, so I decided to discard the <ITEM>. I can't explain it, but somehow I can't compel myself to actually let it go. This <ITEM> is obviously cursed! Now I'm stuck with it. Oh please, I beg you! Take this <ITEM> to <PLACE> Cave and get rid of it and the <ENEMY>s forever! I can't fight, and who knows what's guarding the shrine? Plus, do you know how dirty caves are? It'll ruin anything I wear! Do this for me, and I'll reward you with another one of my curios I picked up a few years ago... a valuable <ITEM>. <ITEM> of Eidolon's Edge."
"I'm <CHARACTER>. You wouldn't happen to be in the market for a home would you? If you are, I just happen to be selling a manor located right here in <PLACE>.

"Do you like parties? Because you've been invited to one. Of course you'll be killing all the other guests. Each guest, at some point in the past, wronged their mysterious host. Now he's hired us to exact his revenge. Are you ready to attend? You need to go to the city of <PLACE>, to the large house known as <PLACE> Manor. There you will meet up with five very unlucky guests. In order to receive your bonus, you must kill each guest secretly, one by one. If anyone sees you committing murder, the bonus is forfeit. The guests believe there is a chest of <ITEM> hidden in the house, and have agreed to be locked inside until one of them finds it. In fact, the guests believe the key to the manor is inside the chest, and only by satisfying their greed will they be allowed to leave. Poor fools. There is, of course, no chest of <ITEM>. The guests will find no key. After you arrive, the doors will be locked behind you, as everyone expects. When all the guests lie dead, you will be free to leave. Now go, see the doorman at <PLACE> Manor. He will explain the rest. Have fun."

Oh, and one more thing. Get into the habit of asking your fellow assassins about any current contract. Their insight may prove invaluable."
